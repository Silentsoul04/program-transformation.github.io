### []{#Overview} Overview

Posters at GPCE provide an excellent forum for authors to present their
work in an informal and interactive setting. Posters are ideal for
presenting speculative, late-breaking results or for giving an
introduction to interesting, innovative work. They are intended to
provide authors and interested participants with the ability to connect
with each other and to engage in discussions about the work. Posters
provide authors with a unique opportunity to make their work highly
visible during the conference. Therefore, authors of other GPCE
technical submissions are encouraged to also submit a poster about their
work. Posters will be on display during the entire conference.

Successful posters are carefully designed to convey technical details.
They should also have a strong visual impact that attracts the attention
of attendees as they stroll past the displays, either during the
interactive poster session or at other times during the conference. The
goal is to develop a poster that encourages and facilitates small groups
of individuals interested in a technical area to gather and interact.
The interactive poster session is held early in the conference, to
promote continued discussion among interested parties.

### []{#Submission_Format} Submission Format

The poster itself or the preliminary graphic layout must be submitted as
a PDF file. A Poster proposal consists of:

-   a 50 word or less short abstract that summarizes the content of the
    poster
-   a set of keywords describing the technical area of the work
-   a two-page extended abstract, suitable for inclusion in the GPCE
    2004 Conference CD
-   the poster itself, or a preliminary graphic layout of the poster
    (please review the poster content guidelines)

The preliminary graphic layout should consist of 1 to 3 pages that
sketch the layout for an ?.?? meter (wide) by ?.?? meter (high) bulletin
board. Please use 10 point or larger font in the preliminary layout, and
12 point or larger in the final poster, so that it is readable. Once you
have submitted your proposal, you will receive confirmation by e-mail
that your proposal has been received and is complete.

Please send poster proposals to the GPCE 2004 Posters Chair TBA to
arrive no later than TBA. For additional information, clarifications,
questions, or special requirements, please also contact .

### []{#Submission_Guidelines} Submission Guidelines

Posters cover the same interest areas as the Technical Papers,
Demonstrations, and Workshops, and provide an opportunity to present
work in a highly visual and interactive format:

-   Conference participants who are giving technology demonstrations
    should consider presenting posters that contain overviews of their
    demonstrations, both to attract additional attendance at
    demonstrations and to increase the visibility of their tools.
-   Technology providers can showcase their tools and technologies with
    posters.
-   The poster session provides graduate students with an outstanding
    forum in which to present and discuss their PhD work.
-   Research laboratories and projects can introduce themselves and
    their key efforts to the community by presenting posters.
-   Workshop organizers and/or attendees may present posters that
    summarize results from GPCE 2003 workshops. The poster session
    provides workshop participants a means of communicating their key
    results to the rest of the community.
-   Authors of work that is presented in the GPCE technical program can
    obtain even more benefit by presenting their work in a poster as
    well. The poster session provides them the opportunity to engage in
    more personal one-on-one discussions.

Suggestions for other key topic areas are also encouraged.

Poster authors are required to attend the scheduled interactive poster
session, staying with their poster so that they can discuss their work
with conference attendees. Some poster authors also post an informal
schedule along with their poster, listing times when they plan to be
available for discussion later on during the conference. Others leave
sign-up sheets for interested viewers to obtain further information. All
posters will have an associated \"message board\", on which viewers can
post comments, ideas, and questions and on which poster authors will be
able to post responses.

Posters are advertised in the Final Program, and authors\' two-page
extended abstracts will appear in the GPCE Conference CD, which will be
distributed at to all GPCE\'04 attendees. Attendees will be able to
learn more about individual posters before or after visiting the
exhibit.
