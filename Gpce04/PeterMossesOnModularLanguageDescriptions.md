### []{#Peter_D_Mosses} Peter D. Mosses

Peter Mosses participated in the development of Denotational Semantics,
in Strachey\'s Programming Research Group at Oxford in the early
1970\'s. Since moving to Aarhus in 1976, the general aim of his research
in the area of semantics has been to combine solid theoretical
foundations with practical applicability. He has focussed on improving
the modularity of semantic descriptions, making some major advances in
this direction. His most recent work provides the basis for a radically
new approach to the development of semantic descriptions. He has also
contributed to CoFI, the Common Framework Initiative for Algebraic
Specification and Development of Software, and the design of CASL, the
Common Algebraic Specification Language (<http://ww.cofi.info>).

### []{#Invited_Talk_on_Modular_Language} Invited Talk on Modular Language Descriptions

Formal semantic descriptions of full-scale programming languages can be
notoriously difficult to write, as well as to read. Writing a
description of a language usually starts from scratch: reuse from
previous language descriptions requires first locating a relevant one,
then manually copying bits of it \-- perhaps with extensive
reformulation. Semantic descriptions are often intricate and
intimidating documents to read, requiring a good grasp of the formalism
used, as well an understanding of the interplay between the parts of the
description concerned with different language constructs. Evolution of
semantic descriptions, to cope with small changes or extensions to the
described language, may require global reformulation.

In other words: however elegant the theoretical foundations of semantic
descriptions may be, their pragmatic aspects are often reminiscent of
programming large systems before modern software engineering techniques
were introduced. A good dose of \'semantics engineering\' is needed:
analogous partly to component engineering (raising the level of
modularization and analysis in semantic descriptions), partly to the use
of domain-specific formalisms (elevating semantic descriptions to
compact domain-specific notations that are easier to read, write and
maintain).

The most extreme modularization imaginable in semantic descriptions is
when each individual programming construct is described as a separate
and independent component. For instance, consider a particular kind of
conditional statement: its description is to be independent of whether
evaluating the condition might have side-effects, throw exceptions, etc.
Such modules could be made available in a repository; a description of a
complete language would then merely refer to the required modules, which
must not need any adaptation when combined. Reuse would be encouraged,
and made explicit. The designer of a new language would be free to focus
on the description of novel constructs.

Unfortunately, some well-known semantic frameworks (e.g., conventional
Structural Operational Semantics and Denotational Semantics) do not
allow such extreme modularization as envisaged above: the description of
each language construct inherently depends on which other (kinds of)
constructs are included in the language being described. Other
frameworks go quite a long way towards it (e.g., Monadic Denotational
Semantics, and the Montages variant of Abstract State Machines). The
following two lesser-known frameworks have recently been adapted
specifically to support extreme modularization:

-   Action Semantics \-- a hybrid of operational and denotational
    semantics, developed since the end of the 80\'s (not to be confused
    with the action semantics of UML); and

<!-- -->

-   Modular SOS (MSOS) \-- a variant of Structural Operational Semantics
    where labels on transitions are fully exploited.

Action Semantics appears to be an appropriate basis for generation of
prototype compilers, and some tool support for developing and validating
semantic descriptions has been implemented. MSOS has so far been used in
earnest only for defining the Action Notation used in Action Semantics,
and for teaching semantics. Both frameworks are quite unbiased towards
description of particular kinds of programming languages, and their
support for extreme modularization should make them especially
attractive for describing domain-specific languages.
