### []{#Overview} Overview

GPCE workshops provide intensive collaborative environments where
generative and component technologists meet to surface, discuss, and
solve challenging problems facing the field.

Workshops occur on the day before the conference. To ensure a
sufficiently small group for effective interaction, workshop organizers
manage attendance based on an objective criterion, typically, a short
position paper submitted by potential attendees. Other criteria are
permitted as long as they are clearly specified in the workshop\'s call
for participation.

We encourage proposals for innovative, well-focused workshops on a broad
spectrum of component engineering and generative programming topics. All
topics related to generative programming and component engineering are
potential candidates for workshops. Workshops typically fall into the
following categories:

-   A workshop may address a specific sub-area of generative and
    component technology in depth.
-   A workshop may cover areas that cross the borders of several sub
    areas. Workshops that cross the borders of the formal and the
    applied areas is one example.
-   A workshop may focus on the applications and deployment of
    generative and/or component technology in areas such as
    telecommunications, mobile computing or real-time systems. Workshops
    reporting on industrial experiences are particularly welcome.

Workshop topics are by no means limited to the types mentioned above.
However, in each case, the proposed area is supposed to have enough
impetus to yield new results that can be considered important and worth
more detailed investigation.

### []{#What_should_a_proposal_look_like} What should a proposal look like?

Workshop proposals should be sent in ASCII or PDF format to the workshop
chair, and they should consist of four pages/parts:

1.  Cover Page
    -   Name of the proposed workshop.
    -   Names and addresses of the organizers.
    -   Intended number of participants.
    -   Requested Audio/Video equipment.
2.  Abstract
    -   Why it is relevant to GPCE and a short overview of the rationale
        for the workshop and the major topics. In particular, statements
        about the review process and ways to ensure creativity during
        the workshop would be appreciated.
    -   The abstract should preferably not exceed 200 words.
3.  Call for Participation
    -   A preliminary version of the Call for Participation that the
        organizers must prepare if the workshop is accepted.
    -   Should provide a brief overview of the proposed workshop
        including a description of the goals of the workshops and the
        work practices.
    -   May repeat some of the statements made on the abstract page, but
        should be targeted specifically to potential workshop
        participants.
4.  Organizers
    -   Short biography of each organizer.
    -   References to similar workshops organized at previous
        conferences, including the number of participants.
    -   If a workshop is accepted, the organizers will be requested to
        prepare a WWW page that will contain the latest information
        about the workshop. The web pages of each workshop will be
        linked to the GPCE workshop web site.
    -   Each workshop must have at least two organizers, preferably from
        different organizations. Preference will be shown to workshops
        that have more organizers. Workshop organizers and participants
        have to register for the conference.

### []{#Recommendations} Recommendations

-   Workshop organizers should in particular take care to foster the
    creative potential that is tentatively present in a workshop.
-   Remember that a workshop is NOT a conference!
-   The success of a workshop depends greatly on the results generated
    on-site.
-   A number of interrelated issues should be taken into account in
    order to provide a good framework for such on-site creativity.

<!-- -->

-   Time allocation
    -   During the workshop, enough time should be reserved for
        collaborative work.
    -   Such creative sessions should have a precise topic and objective
        and their results should be written down so that they can be
        reported later. Reasonable expectations
    -   One should not count on people\'s instantaneous and proactive
        participation.
    -   For many reasons, participants tend to prefer a consumer role
        much to a producer role during a workshop.
    -   Thus prescreened presentations, even formally reviewed papers,
        should usually precede any creative sessions. Task forces
    -   Large groups tend to behave like an audience, whereas groups of
        four to eight people are much more likely to interact.
    -   When planning collaborative sessions, consider having several
        smaller groups rather than one large group in order to foster
        the generation of new ideas.

<!-- -->

-   Presentation selection
    -   Quality should obviously be the primary criterion for selecting
        the presentations.
    -   However, in order for a workshop to be productive, consider also
        having presentations on some new, controversial topics to spark
        discussion.
-   Participant selection
    -   Although the number of workshop participants does not need to be
        restricted to the selected presenters, the overall size of the
        workshop should remain small enough to foster creativity.
    -   Usually this means less than 20 participants.

### []{#Submission_Process} Submission Process

Electronic submission of proposals is required\--send to
<workshops04@gpce.org>. Proposals must be submitted no later than March
19, 2004, BUT EARLIER IS BETTER, as it allows for a more satisfactory
coordination between workshop proposals.

Proposal Review and Acceptance

The proposals received will be reviewed by the Workshop Committee to
determine a high quality and appropriate mix for the conference.
