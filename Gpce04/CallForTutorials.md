### []{#Important_Dates} Important Dates

-   Proposal submission deadline: April 2, 2004
-   Notification of acceptance: May 10, 2004
-   Camera ready notes: August 6, 2004
-   Conference: October 24-28, 2004
-   Tutorial day: October 24, 2004

### []{#Overview} Overview

Proposals for high-quality tutorials in all areas of generative
programming and component-based development, from academic research to
industrial applications, are solicited. Tutorial levels may be
introductory, intermediate, or advanced.

A tutorial\'s basic purpose is to give a deeper or more covering insight
into its area than a conventional lecture would do. That is why it
extends over a half or a full day. This gives the speaker better
possibilities to structure the tutorial in a proper manner.

The topic of a tutorial can come from a truly broad spectrum. Any
interesting theme from or related to the GPCE\'04 [Call for
Papers](CallForPapers){.twikiLink} topic list is welcome, from surveys
to experience reports or specialized research topics. However, one
should keep in mind that a tutorial can be expected to attract a
reasonable number of participants (at least 6 participants). This is
most likely the case if the topic is new or relevant to a broad
community. If you think that you are highly experienced in a certain
area of object-orientation and that others could benefit from sharing
this experience with you, you should submit a proposal.

### []{#Submission_Format} Submission Format

The earlier a proposal arrives, the better the chances to get feedback
in order to bring the proposal into a form that is likely to be
accepted. Proposals must be submitted electronically via e-mail
according to the following template:

1.  Title
    -   Select an expressive title that captures the contents of your
        tutorial well without being too long.
    -   Remember that the title must be attractive and should make a
        reader curious.
    -   In exceptional cases we may re-edit the title in order to make
        it consistent with other tutorial titles.
2.  Speaker(s)
    -   Give the full name and address of the tutorial speaker.
    -   If there are multiple speakers, give this information for all of
        them but clearly specify who the contact person is.
    -   Don\'t forget to specify the electronic mail address.
3.  Abstract
    -   Give a concise description of the contents and goals of your
        tutorial.
    -   The abstract will be used for the Advance Program.
    -   It should not be longer than 150 words.
    -   If it is longer, be prepared to have it cut or re-edited.
4.  Outline
    -   This information will be used by the tutorial committee for
        reviewing the detailed tutorial contents.
    -   The outline should be a table of contents of the tutorial, with
        a few keywords for each section, and with a rough estimate of
        the time spent on each.
5.  Duration
    -   Tutorials can be half-day or full-day.
    -   Half-day tutorials are preferred. A half-day tutorial should
        last for 3.5 hours including a half an hour break.
    -   A full-day tutorial should last for 7 hours including two half
        an hour and excluding the lunch break.
6.  Level
    -   The tutorial level can be introductory (requires almost no
        experience with object-orientation), intermediate (assumes
        knowledge of object-oriented concepts but little or no
        experience with the tutorial\'s subject), or advanced (assumes
        several years of practical experience with object-orientation
        and preferably also some experience with the tutorial\'s
        subject).
7.  Required experience
    -   Clearly state what knowledge you expect from your participants.
    -   This information will be included in the Advance Program.
    -   It should not be longer than 20 words.
8.  Expected audience
    -   Who should attend this tutorial?
    -   How will the participants benefit from attending?
9.  Speaker\'s profile
    -   Describe your affiliation, interests and experience.
    -   It should be clear from this text that you are the right person
        to give this tutorial.
10. Speaker\'s profile for the Advance Program
    -   Provide a short version of the Speaker\'s profile to be included
        in the Advance Program.
    -   It should not be longer than 40 words.
11. Tutorial resume
    -   Has this tutorial been given before?
    -   How many participants were there?
    -   If available, please specify the ratings that the participants
        gave to your tutorial.
12. Equipment
    -   Please specify the equipment you need, e.g., number of slide
        projectors, video projection facilities, computer tables, power
        plugs, paper boards, etc.
    -   Note that we may not be able to provide computers for all the
        participants.
13. Presentations
    -   Tutorial ma/literials such as slides and handouts should be
        included if available, but are not required for submission.
        Providing such materials will show depth and maturity of the
        tutorial, however, and will be a factor in the selection
        process. If the tutorial is new, it would still be useful to
        include a few sample slides that let the committee judge the
        expected quality of the presentation.

### []{#What_should_a_tutorial_look_like} What should a tutorial look like?

If you never presented a tutorial before here are some suggestions that
may help you in preparing your presentation.

1.  Contents
    -   When preparing the tutorial, keep your audience in mind.
    -   People don\'t pay for a tutorial in order to hear things that
        they already know or that are irrelevant for their work.
    -   So don\'t be vague, don\'t waste time with lengthy
        introductions, but speak to the point.
    -   Don\'t try to impress the audience with the amount of your
        research, but convey practical knowledge and ideas that the
        participants will find useful for their own work.
    -   Whenever possible, use examples and case studies and avoid
        lengthy abstract passages.
    -   Also consider demonstrations on video or an overhead panel.
    -   In order to get an audience as homogeneous as possible, clearly
        state which knowledge you expect from the participants in the
        tutorial description.
2.  Slides and notes
    -   You will have to prepare tutorial notes for the participants.
    -   These handouts usually contain copies of the slides that you
        show.
    -   Here are a few guidelines for preparing the slides and the
        handouts.
    -   Use at least a 14 pt (or better an 18 pt) font on all of your
        slides.
    -   A good slide should not just repeat everything you say but
        summarize your presentation.
    -   Use short phrases and keywords instead of full sentences.
    -   People cannot read as fast as you speak. Make heavy use of
        pictures and examples.
    -   Consider also using the blackboard for short examples.
    -   Use colors where they are helpful, but remember that they will
        not appear in the black and white handouts.
    -   Don\'t put too much or too little material on a single slide.
    -   A good rule of thumb is to spend 3 minutes per slide.
    -   Don\'t include slides that you will skip in the presentation;
        people will find that annoying.
    -   You will have to deliver the tutorial notes in camera-ready form
        (see the deadline below).
    -   We request that you send them as hard copy, so consider the
        postage delay to meet the deadline.
    -   To avoid wasting paper, copy two slides on a single page
        (reduced size). The printed area of such a page must not exceed
        27 x 17cm (10.5 x 6.7 inch).
    -   In addition to the slide copies, also consider providing
        full-text handouts (papers, summaries, bibliography, etc.).
        Participants will appreciate that.
    -   The maximum length of the notes for a half-day tutorial should
        be 50 pages for slide copies and another 20 pages for full-text
        material. For full-day tutorials these numbers can be doubled.
    -   Try to achieve good printing quality.
    -   We will add an uniform cover page to all tutorial notes.
3.  Presentation
    -   The participants expect that your presentation will be much
        easier to understand than a book about the same subject.
    -   Thus speak clearly and lively. Try to interact with your
        audience.
    -   Encourage them to ask questions.
    -   A presentation is much more lively if it also includes examples
        and demonstrations on the blackboard, on video or on an overhead
        panel.
    -   Tutorials should be split into sessions of 1.5 hours each with a
        0.5 hour coffee break in between.
    -   Don\'t overrun your tutorial time. After the tutorial the
        participants will be asked to assess the tutorial with a
        questionnaire.
    -   A good rating will help you when applying for other tutorials in
        the future.

Although GPCE is co-located with OOPSLA, each conference has a separate
submission process for tutorials (the co-location should not be
understood to mean that these are the same tutorial calls). The OOPSLA
call for tutorials can be found at
