[]{#MVCDC_2_Second_Workshop_on_Manag} MVCDC 2: Second Workshop on Managing Variabilities consistently in Design and Code - OOPSLA 2005
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### []{#ABSTRACT} ABSTRACT

With the introduction of software product line approaches into the
practice, variants and variability add a new dimension of complexity to
the software development process. The combinatorial explosion of
possible variants in systems with a high degree of variability requires
improved and changed concepts for specifying, modeling, and implementing
these systems to assure quality and functionality.

Current OO technologies and standardized design languages fall short in
offering appropriate support for designing and implementing
variabilities. Additionally the integration of design tools and
implementation technologies concerning variants is still poor.

The main goal is to discuss and identify efficient ways for dealing with
highly variable software systems on design and code level by evaluating
existing approaches and new ideas from the research community and
industrial practice.

Potential topics include, but are not limited to:

-   tools and processes for managing variants
-   modeling languages for capturing variants
-   code generation support
-   feature oriented development tools and technologies
-   languages for independent feature development and feature
    composition
-   AO approaches for independent feature development and feature
    composition
-   Integration of variant management into model driven software
    development techniques
-   Support for model to model and model to code transformations

### []{#IMPORTANT_DATES} IMPORTANT DATES

-   Position Papers Due: Friday, **August 26, 2005**
-   Notification of Acceptance: Friday, **September 9, 2005**
-   Workshop: Thursday, **October 20, 2005**

### []{#WORKSHOP_ACTIVITIES} WORKSHOP ACTIVITIES

The workshop is laid out as full day workshop. Instead of presenting the
papers, each participant will be expected to review everyone else\'s
paper before the workshop and complete the following two sentences for
each:

-   What I really liked about this paper is \...
-   The most important question I would like to ask the author is \...

These answers are written down on index cards and will be collected
before the workshop. During the workshop, we will spend the morning with
questions and answers to gain deeper insight into the problem described
in the paper. Before each paper session, the author will be permitted a
4 minute slot to very briefly present his paper/work. The workshop
format in the afternoon will be utilizing the \"Open Space\" format in
order to discuss topics of interest that might be, or might not be
directly related to the papers presented in the morning.

### []{#PARTICIPATION} PARTICIPATION

Every interested person is invited to apply for attendance by sending a
position paper to the organizers. The submission should be one to two
pages describing the key ideas. Submissions will be reviewed by the
organizers. The authors will be notified about acceptance before the
early registration deadline.
