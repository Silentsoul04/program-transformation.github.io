[]{#Separate_Compilation} Separate Compilation
----------------------------------------------

The basic implementation of separate compilation of Stratego programs
has been available from [StrategoXT
0.9.4](StrategoRelease094){.twikiLink}, but the feature has always been
experimental. However, it was already clear that separate compilation
drastically reduces the compilation time of Stratego programs. The open
issues in the implementation of separate compilation, which are mostly
configuration related, have all been resolved in this release,
StrategoXT 0.11. Therefore, separate compilation of Stratego is now
ready for use.

First, AutoXT has been extended with support for separate compilation.
Because of the support in AutoXT, using separate compilation in your
packages is very easy. Second, separate compilation is now also
supported for XTC tools, for which it is particularly useful. Third, the
stand-alone Stratego compiler `strc` now accepts flags for separate
compilation. This is very convenient for small tests programs, or just
for testing separate compilation.

The exact details of using separate compilation are explained in a [how
to](HowToUseSeparateCompilation){.twikiLink} available at the Stratego
website (documentation section).

(Eelco Visser and Martin Bravenboer)

[]{#Shared_libraries_in_the_Stratego} Shared libraries in the Stratego runtime
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In StrategoXT 0.11 the Stratego Runtime System (srts) uses Libtool to
build libraries. This means that shared libraries are created if the
platform supports this. Since linkers by default prefer shared libraries
over static libraries, your programs will be linked against the shared
libraries of the Stratego runtime. This reduces the size of the
executable and the code of the library will be shared by all Stratego
programs.

Using shared libraries introduces the usual problems of locating these
libraries when a program is executed. This might cause problems for
users of your packages: if you do not change the way your programs are
linked, then at most systems the shared libraries will not be found if
the package is installed at a non-standard location. To solve this
issue, we advice to use Libtool for linking, since Libtool adds the path
of a dynamic library to the search path of an executable. For an
overview of all options to avoid or prefer shared libraries, see the
[how to use shared libraries](HowToUseSharedLibraries){.twikiLink} at
the Stratego website.

(Martin Bravenboer)

[]{#Cygwin_and_Mac_OS_X_Support} Cygwin and Mac OS X Support
------------------------------------------------------------

For StrategoXT 0.10 we announced support for Mac OS X. Unfortunately,
this claim soon appeared to be poorly verified: we received several
reports of failures at Mac OS X. For StrategoXT 0.11, we have worked on
solving all these issues and can now safely re-announce support for Mac
OS X. StrategoXT 0.11 has been compiled and checked at two different Mac
OS X 10.3.4 systems with Apple\'s GCC 3.3 (unpatched). Older versions of
GCC will probably not work. From now on, binary distributions for Mac OS
X will be available at the release page.

Various problems had to be fixed in order to support Mac OS X:

-   A very creepy issue with optimizations performed by GCC has been
    worked-around in the implementation of the `some` traversal
    primitive.

<!-- -->

-   Various issues with separate compilation at Mac OS X have been
    resolved. For example, initializers of dynamic libraries are by
    default invoked in a lazy way at Mac OS X, which Stratego separate
    compilation does not allow. This issue has been fixed in AutoXT by
    passing a flag to the linker at Darwin systems.

<!-- -->

-   The stand-alone Stratego compiler now passes more standard flags to
    GCC.

(Eelco Dolstra, Martin Bravenboer and Dick Eimers)

Cygwin support has also been verified. Unfortunately, separate
compilation is currently not supported at Cygwin, due to limitations of
Microsoft Windows DLLs. As a result, static linking is used for the
separately compiled SSL and executables are rather large. We hope to fix
this in a future release. From StrategoXT 0.11 binary distributions for
Cygwin will be available at the release pages.

(Eelco Dolstra and Martin Bravenboer)

[]{#Various_Deployment_Improvements} Various Deployment Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Besides the support for Mac OS X and Cygwin, the deployment of
StrategoXT has been improved at several other points. First, the
distributions of StrategoXT 0.11 are much smaller then the distributions
of the last few releases. A source distribution is now about 9 MB, which
used to be 14 MB. This has been achieved by (1) not distributing
bootstrapped sources of programs that are only used in a check, (2) not
distributing parse tables, (3) reduction of the size of bootstrapped
sources by heavy use of separate compilation in StrategoXT, (4) removing
some tools that are obsolete or not working properly.

Second, the dependencies of StrategoXT are now finally checked in the
configure script. If the provided configuration is incorrect, then the
configure will fail and explain where the tools were expected in the
configuration provided (or not) by the user. The configure scripts
checks for the ATerm-gcc library in the aterm package, which reflects
the requirement to configure this package with the \--with-gcc flag. The
StrategoXT configure script now also checks for several tools that are
part of the packages of the sdf2-bundle.

The checks have been implemented as macros (`XT_PKG_ATERM` and
`XT_PKG_SDF`) in AutoXT, so you can use them in your package as well.
The macro `XT_PKG_STRATEGOXT` can be used if you want to check that the
provided configuration for StrategoXT is correct. This macro checks that
some essential tools in StrategoXT are available at the specified
prefix. If you want to, then you can also invoke the checks for the
specific program directly: they are available as XT\_PROG\_ macros in
AutoXT.

(Martin Bravenboer)

[]{#Upgrade_of_SDF_Packages} Upgrade of SDF Packages
----------------------------------------------------

StrategoXT 0.11 uses a new version of the SDF language and its
implementation. The SDF packages are collected in the sdf2-bundle 2.2,
which is available at the release page of StrategoXT 0.11.

Important: the new version of SDF contains a new construct for declaring
start symbols of the syntax definition. In older versions of SDF there
was no way to declare start symbols. Instead, all declared sorts were
implicitly added as start symbols. You must add this new explicit
declaration of start-symbols to your syntax definition, otherwise the
generated parse table will not parse anything at all. For example, if
you want `Module` to be a start symbol of your syntax definition, then
you should add a declaration `context-free start-symbols Module` to you
syntax definition. You can also declare more complex start symbols, for
example lists. Declaring all sorts (in a `sorts` construct)is now
encouraged, since the parse table generator is then able to do more
static checking of the syntax definition and warn you about suspicious
constructs.

(Martin Bravenboer)

[]{#Support_for_XML_Processing} Support for XML Processing
----------------------------------------------------------

StrategoXT 0.11 has a new sub-package: *xml-front*. This package
contains an SDF syntax definition for XML, a pretty-printer for XML, an
embedding of XML in Stratego, and various tools for XML processing. The
syntax definition of XML and the accompanying tools can be used for the
implementation of XML transformations, for generating XML (e.g. XHTML
web pages) or for interoperability with external XML-based tools. How to
use the tools of xml-front for XML applications will be explained in
some howtos at the Stratego Wiki. The first one will explain the
embedding of XML in Stratego, which is in particular useful for
generating XML in Stratego programs.

(Martin Bravenboer)

[]{#New_and_Improved_Tools} New and Improved Tools
--------------------------------------------------

Many tools in StrategoXT have been improved. Some highlights:

*pack-sdf* now supports the \"-Idef Foo.def\" flag. This flag can be
used to import SDF modules (.sdf) from an SDF syntax definition (.def).
The order of mixed -I and -Idef arguments is respected.

*sdf2parenthesize* is a new tool that generates a Stratego
transformation tool that adds the necessary parentheses to an abstract
syntax tree. The information is obtained from an SDF syntax definition.
The tool handles associativity, relative priorities, and groups of
associative productions. The tool has successfully been applied to
improve the pretty-printers of Stratego in stratego-front and Java in
[JavaFront](JavaFront){.twikiLink}. The tool is explained in more detail
at the Tools web:
[sdf2parenthesize](../Tools/SdfToParenthesize){.twikiLink}.

*sdf2rtg*, which is used for the generation of Stratego signatures, now
uses the real start symbols of the SDF syntax definition and not the
declared sorts. sdf2rtg also complains if the syntax definition contains
no start symbols at all.

(Martin Bravenboer)

[]{#New_strategies_in_the_Stratego_l} New strategies in the Stratego library
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Stratego Standard Library has been extended with several useful
strategies.

The `newname` strategy is a variant of the `new` strategy. It generates
unique strings, just like new, but it also accepts a prefix that will be
part of the generated string. By default, the numbering is also done per
prefix. For example, if you apply `newname` three times to the string
`"foo"`, then the results will be `"foo_0"`, `"foo_1"` and `"foo_2"`. If
`newname` is applied to `"bar"` after this, then the result will be
`"bar_0"`, not `"bar_4"`. Thus, The `newname` strategy is very useful
for generating more user-friendly, unique names in a program
transformation.

(Arthur van Dam)

The new `sets` module provides support for efficient, stateful sets,
comparable to stateful hashtables in the `tables` module. Like
hashtables, the set implementation is based on an implementation of this
data structure in the ATerm library.

(Martin Bravenboer)

The `posix-file` module has been extended with the directory primitives
`mkdir` and `rmdir`. The new strategy `filemode` returns the mode of a
file. The strategy `mkdtemp` can be used to created temporary
directories, similar to `mkstemp`.

The module `char-io` has been extended with the strategy
`filter-text-file` for filtering character sequences from text files.
This strategy is especially useful if you need to filter a file in a way
that depends on characters in multiple lines of the input.
`filter-text-file` is parameterized with two strategies: a strategy for
transforming the current \'chunk\' of characters and a strategy to
commit the current chunk.

(Eelco Visser)

[]{#Various_improvements_of_XTC} Various improvements of XTC
------------------------------------------------------------

In StrategoXT 0.11 AutoXT constructs build-time XTC repositories. Such a
build-time XTC repository refers to files in the build tree, instead of
the installation directory. The build-time repository is named XTC and
is created in the top-level directory of the build tree. Build-time
repositories can be used to invoke tools in the build tree at build- or
check-time. Thus, build-time XTC repositories can be used to support a
\'make check\' without having the package installed. Indeed, the
[StrategoShell](StrategoShell){.twikiLink} and
[JavaFront](JavaFront){.twikiLink} have already been changed to use the
build-time repositories and now fully support a pre-install check and
\'make distcheck\'. For StrategoXT a \'make install\' is still required
before you can do a \'make check\'.

From StrategoXT 0.11, XTC tools can be compiled with stand-alone
Stratego compiler. Until now, XTC tools could only be compiled in
complete AutoXT-based packages. From this release, `strc` takes a flag
`--xtc-repo` to set the default XTC repository when invoking strc as a
full program compiler. This argument has no meaning if strc is
instructed to produce only C code. The definition of a default XTC
repository with the `--xtc-repo` flag is optional: if you leave it out,
the tool will have no default XTC repository and will use the
environment variable `XTC_REPOSITORY` or a repository that is passed to
the tool when it is invoked. In this way, it is now much easier to
implement ad-hoc Stratego programs that invoke other tools using XTC. It
might also be useful for users that are new to XTC and just want to
experiment without setting up an entire package.

(Martin Bravenboer)

[]{#Global_choice_operator} Global choice operator
--------------------------------------------------

The global choice operator is now much easier to use. The global choice
operator `++` was introduced in Stratego 0.7, but to use it, StrategoXT
had to be configured with the location of the CPL. If the CPL was
available, then it was used for *all* programs compiled with this
installation of StrategoXT. In StrategoXT 0.11 we have moved the choice
for the implementation of choice-points to link-time. This is now much
more flexible and easy to use: the new version of the CPL for StrategoXT
(will be released in a few days) can be installed *after* the
installation of StrategoXT and for each program you can decide if you
want to use the implementation of global choices in the CPL. If a
program uses the global choice, but it is not linked with the CPL, then
linking will fail.

If the CPL is installed and registered in the XTC repository of
StrategoXT, then the Stratego compiler accepts a new argument `--cpl`,
which will link the program with the CPL. The argument is not visible if
the CPL has not been registered in the XTC repository that is used by
strc. The new configuration for the CPL and the new strc option for
linking with the CPL, make it very easy to experiment with the global
choice implementation.

(Martin Bravenboer)

[]{#Many_bug_fixes} Many bug-fixes
----------------------------------

In StrategoXT 0.11 many bugs have been fixed in tools, the library, and
the compiler. Some highlights:

-   fixed a bug in the implementation of `mkstemp` that causes
    segmentation faults in large programs that use this strategy. In
    particular, all XTC tools in 0.9.4, 0.9.5 and 0.10 are affected. The
    segmentation fault occurs during garbage collection of ATerms by the
    ATerm library.

<!-- -->

-   Several bugs have been fixed in the new implementation of dynamic
    rules, which was introduced in StrategoXT 0.10. Also, the
    performance of scope labeling has been improved by applying the new
    stateful sets.

<!-- -->

-   In the backend of the Stratego compiler a bug has been fixed in the
    generation of code for mutual recursive strategies declared locally
    in a let. The backend of strc now declares all local functions
    before defining them.
