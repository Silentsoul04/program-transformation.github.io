[Nemerle](http://www.nemerle.org/) is a new hybrid (functional,
object-oriented and imperative) programming language for the .NET
platform.

Key features of the language include:

-   simplicity,
-   C\#-like syntax,
-   easy to use object system (derived directly from the .NET),
-   easy access to both functional and imperative features,
-   powerful code-generating macros,
-   variants,
-   pattern matching,
-   static and on-demand dynamic typing,
-   type inference.

We plan to make language full CLS consumer and producer soon.

[Scala](http://scala.epfl.ch/index.html) is a new programming language
designed by Martin Odersky. According to the announcement:

*Scala smoothly integrates object-oriented and functional programming.
It is designed to express common programming patterns in a concise,
elegant, and type-safe way. Scala introduces several innovative language
constructs. For instance:*

-   Abstract types and mixin composition unify ideas from object and
    module systems.

<!-- -->

-   Pattern matching over class hierarchies unifies functional and
    object-oriented data access. It greatly simplifies the processing of
    XML trees.

<!-- -->

-   A flxible syntax and type system enables the construction of
    advanced libraries and new domain specific languages.

**[Classboxes](http://www.iam.unibe.ch/%7Escg/Research/Classboxes/index.html):
A Minimal Module System Supporting Local Rebinding**

*Classical modules systems support well the modular development of
applications but lack the ability to add or replace a method in a class
that is not defined in that module. But languages that support method
addition and replacement do not provide a modular view of applications,
and their changes have a global impact. The result is a gap between
module systems for object-oriented languages on one hand, and the very
desirable feature of method addition and replacement on the other hand.*

To solve these problems we present classboxes, a module system for
object-oriented languages that allows method addition and replacement.
Moreover, the changes made by a classbox are only visible to that
classbox (or classboxes that import it), a feature we call **local
rebinding**.

This is a notion needed in Stratego to come to terms with the extension
of strategies in different modules. Currently this is at the loss of
separate compilation.

Recently [Pierre-Etienne Moreau](http://www.loria.fr/~moreau/) gave a
talk at the [PEM](http://www.cwi.nl/~pem) at CWI about *Formal Islands:
introducing algebraic pattern matching facilities into a classical
language.*

The notion of formal islands (think of island grammars) is a way of
integrating algebraic notions into existing programs written in C or
Java for example. As shown by ASF+SDF and ELAN, many processes can be
seen as transformations of tree-like data structures. In compiler
construction, for example, we continuously manipulate trees and perform
tree transformations. In order to simplify the implementation of these
transformations (in C or Java), and reduce the risk of error, we have
introduced a pattern matching compiler: TOM. In this talk, I will
introduce the language and its (informal) semantics and give several
examples of applications, ranging from small XML transformations to the
TOM compiler itself. TOM is developed by INRIA (<http://tom.loria.fr>)
and is available as an eclipse plugin. This bundle contains the ATerm
library and integrates an ApiGen plugin.

The programming language Scheme does not natively include pattern

can be become quite sophisticated, e.g., including regular expressions.

Dave Thomas: ["The Impedance Imperative -- Tuples+Objects+Infosets=Too
Much Stuff!"](http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2003_09/column1), in
Journal of Object Technology, vol. 2, no. 5, September-October 2003, pp.
7-12.

This article discusses the complexity of writing software that
manipulates structured information. The move from tuples to objects to
the xml info set has made writing these rather basic applications
unnecessary complex, mostly because there hasn\'t been a real move. Dave
Thomas challenges us to step back and think about where we should go
now.

The [Lightweight Languages](http://ll3.ai.mit.edu/) workshop series
focuses on programming languages, tools, and processes that are usable
and useful. In particular some interesting ideas for \'Disruptive
Programming Language Technologies\' in Todd Proebsting\'s talk at LL2.
Here is the abstract of the talk:

For the past few decades, programming language design and implementation
research has concentrated heavily in a few notable areas: type theory,
functional programming, object-oriented programming, and, of course,
optimization techniques. Yet most of the recent commercially successful
languages (e.g., Perl, Python, Visual Basic, Java) are not particularly
interesting when judged in these domains. What happened? The newly
successful languages represented a \"disruptive technology\" that
allowed it to capture programmer mindshare while everybody else was
looking. In this talk, I will present what I think makes a programming
language technology disruptive, and I will propose possible future
disruptive programming language technologies.

Special Issue of [FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE](http://fi.mimuw.edu.pl/) on
PROGRAM TRANSFORMATION: Theoretical Foundations and Basic Techniques

Guest Editors: Alberto Pettorossi, University of Roma Tor Vergata, Italy
and Maurizio Proietti, IASI CNR, Roma, Italy

<http://www.iasi.rm.cnr.it/~adp/fi_pt.html>

This special issue is devoted to the various aspects of program
transformation as they developed during the last decades in different
programming paradigms such as imperative, functional, and logic
languages. It gives special emphasis to the theoretical foundations and
basic techniques of program transformation such as: the various
approaches and formalisms, the correctness of the transformations, the
relationship with program analysis, program synthesis, program
specialization, partial evaluation, and theorem proving.

In a set of slides [Bill Pugh](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/) gives a
reaction to Proebsting\'s law (compiler optimizations double the speed
of programs every 18 years) under the title [Is Code Optimization
Research
Relevant?](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/IsCodeOptimizationRelevant.pdf)
One of his conclusions is that rather than squeezing another percent
speedup out of artificial benchmarks, optimization research should be
directed at optimization of high-level constructs, thus encouraging
higher-level programming.

[Ronald Bourret](http://www.rpbourret.com/)\'s paper on [XML Data
Binding Resources](http://www.rpbourret.com/xml/XMLDataBinding.htm) says
that

> XML data binding is the binding of XML documents to objects designed
> especially for the data in those documents. This allows applications
> (usually data-centric) to manipulate data that has been serialized as
> XML in a way that is more natural than using the DOM.
