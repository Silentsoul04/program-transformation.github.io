[]{#Versioning} Versioning
--------------------------

The refactoring is being released in a number of milestone releases. The
first was 0.15, subsequent releases are numbered 0.16M1, 0.16M2, etc.

We have introduced a new versioning scheme for unstable releases.
Intermediate versions on the way to a new major release get an M n
suffix indicating that the release is the n-th milestone towards the
major release.

This NEWS file presents the result of the entire operation, i.e., it
discusses the integral set of changes since the previous major release
(0.14).

The release notes at the end of this file show the issues addressed in
each milestone. (Although issues from later milestones may be included
in earlier releases.)

[]{#Stratego_Language} Stratego Language
----------------------------------------

### []{#Stratego_Core_Language} Stratego Core Language

The Stratego Core language project constitutes a major refactoring of
the syntax definition of the language, also requiring a refactoring of
all tools and components processing Stratego programs (in particular the
compiler).

The project was prompted by the problems encountered in building the
first version of the Stratego Optimizer in 2003. In particular, with the
representation of term annotations in the abstract syntax. In addition
the language design had eroded somewhat over the years through the
addition of new features.

Thus, the aims of the project are threefold:

\(1) Clearly distinguish a core language to be used as intermediate
language in the compiler.

\(2) Explicitly represent term annotations in the abstract syntax of the
core language.

\(3) Cleaning up the language, removing constructs that have not proven
to be useful, or have been subsumed by more more general constructs.

### []{#Impact} Impact

Despite the changes in the *structure* of the language, the syntax is
backwards compatible. This entails that existing applications should
still work. Except of course for applications using constructs that have
been removed. However, the decision to remove constructs was based on
the fact that these were not used (some not even document), so this
shouldn\'t pose a big problem. The only change with potential impact is
discontinuation of support for old style dynamic rules. New style
dynamic rules are the default in [StrategoXT](StrategoXT){.twikiLink}
0.14 and should be a good platform for preparing migration.

### []{#Core_vs_Sugar} Core vs Sugar

The syntax definition is now divided into a Stratego-Core language that
is extended to the full language in Stratego-Sugar, adding syntactic
abstractions to the Core. The Core is a strict subset of the full
language. In addition, a number of regular tree grammars has been
defined that denote a number of intermediate languages between
Stratego-Sugar and Stratego-Core. These RTGs are used by the compiler to
verify the sanity of the compiler components.

### []{#Term_Annotations} Term Annotations

Term annotations were not originally supported in Stratego. The addition
was handled by desugaring the matching and building of terms with
annotions to calls to ATerm library functions using primitives in an
early stage of compilation. The implicit presence of annotations made
transformations within the compiler very fragile, and entailed that
certain optimizations could not be defined properly.

In the new core syntax, terms always have an annotation. A pre-term (pt)
has the form

pt := i \| r \| x \| c(t1,\...,tn)

and denotes a term without annotation. A term (t) is a pre-term with an
annotation (which is itself a pre-term):

t := pt{\^pt}

This is the explicit representation of term annotations; every term
always has a list of annotations. That is, the annotation pre-term
should always be a **list** of the form

Cons(t1,\...,Cons(tn, Nil())

Since most terms do not have annotations, or we\'re not interested in
them, in the sugared extension of the core language, term annotations
are optional. Thus, in Stratego-Sugar, the syntax of terms is extended
with:

t := pt \| pt{t1,\...,tn}

The interpretation of this syntax depends on the use of the term in a
match or build position. That is, the following desugaring rules apply:

  ---------------------- ----- ------------------------------------------
  \[ pt \]               -\>   \[ pt{\^Nil()} \]
  \[ pt{t1,\...,tn} \]   -\>   \[ pt{\^Cons(t1,\...,Cons(tn,Nil()))} \]
  ---------------------- ----- ------------------------------------------

  ----------------------- ----- -------------------------------------------
  \[ ?pt \]               -\>   \[ ?pt{\^\_} \]
  \[ ?pt{t1,\...,tn} \]   -\>   \[ ?pt{\^Cons(t1,\...,Cons(tn,Nil()))} \]
  ----------------------- ----- -------------------------------------------

(Note that this is a bit simplified, as the Conses and Nils in the
right-hand side have annotations themselves, except for the outermost
ones.)

So a rewrite rule

A : Plus(x, y) -\> Plus(y, x)

is desugared to

A : Plus(x, y){\^\_} -\> Plus(y, x){\^Nil()}

(STR-58)

### []{#Disambiguation} Disambiguation

The syntax of types of higher-order arguments of strategy definitions
was ambiguous. Thus, the type of the skip argument in

      topdownS(s : ATerm() -> ATerm() , skip : a -> a * a -> a) = ...

could be parsed as

      a -> (a * a -> a)   or ((a -> a) * a) -> a

This has been solved by only allowing function types as argument types
when between parentheses. Thus, the above is not syntactically valid,
but should now be written as

      topdownS(s : ATerm() -> ATerm() , skip : (a -> a) * a -> a) = ...

It is better to require explicit disambiguation since it is easy to have
the wrong expectation from implicit disambiguation in this case.

There was no priority definition between guarded left-choice and
non-deterministic choice, such that the expression

      s1 < s2 + s3 + s4

could be parsed in two ways, i.e.,

      s1 < (s2 + s3) + s4   or   s1 < s2 + (s3 + s4) 

This has been resolved by giving the `+` operator higher priority than
guarded choice to prefer the latter over the former. The first variant
can be selected by using explicit parentheses.

(Eelco Visser)

### []{#Rules_in_let} Rules in let

Let bindings can now introduce new rules. For example,

      main =
        let Foo : 1 -> 2
         in <Foo> 1 => 2
        end 

Local rules shadow rules with the same name (and arity) at top-lovel.
The scope of the rule variables is the enclosing definition, not just
the rule itself! This is in line with the semantics of local
definitions, but the practicality of this design choice should be
reviewed.

(Martin Bravenboer)

### []{#Outdated_constructs_no_longer_su} Outdated constructs no longer supported

A number of language constructs have been subsumed by more general
constructs, or were simply never used. These constructs have been
removed from the language definition starting with this release.

*Old style dynamic rules* are no longer supported. Everything
expressible with old style rules can also be expressed with new style
dynamic rules. See the paper \'Program Transformation with Scoped
Dynamic Rewrite Rules\' for definition and examples of new style dynamic
rules.

*Contextual rules* can now better be expressed using dynamic rules.
Local uses of contextual rules can also be defined using a local
traversal. See the paper \'Strategic Pattern Matching\' for a discussion
of translation of contextual rules that can be applied by hand.

*Literate programming comments* such as

    \begin{code}
      foo = ...
    \end{code}

are no longer supported. Use standard comment delimiters instead.

Other constructs that are discontinued are *strategy rules* of the form

    L :: s1 --> s2

The thread traversal operator (can be expressed in the library), and
threading and distributing congruence operators.

TODO: overlays

(Eelco Visser)

### []{#Calling_strategies_by_their_name} Calling strategies by their name

Strategies can now be called dynamically by name.

      !"do-it-now" => f ; call(f | s | t )

Above dynamic call calls the do-it-now strategy with s as strategy
argument and t as term argument. If the strategy does not exist (given
the name, and arities) the dynamic call will fail without warning.

At the moment it is necessary to \'register\' a strategy to be able to
call it dynamically. Make a dummy strategy DYNAMIC-CALLS with static
calls to the strategies you want to call dynamically.

      DYNAMICAL-CALLS = do-it-now(!1 | 1)

This is only temporary until we find a good syntax for specifying this.

(Rob Vermaas)

[]{#Stratego_Core_Compiler} Stratego Core Compiler
--------------------------------------------------

The Stratego compiler now compiles programs according to the
Stratego-Sugar syntax definition. The front-end of the compiler is
drastically refactored and simplified. The optimizer has been disabled
in this release. Migration and improvement of the optimizer has been
planned for release 0.15.4.

### []{#Format_Checking} Format Checking

The compiler monitors its own integrity by checking the format of
intermediate results against subsets of the Regular Tree Grammar of the
complete syntax definition. By default checks are only carried out at a
few places, to save compile time. In case an error occurs, the level of
checking can be increased using the `--format-check` option of strc.

### []{#List_Variables} List Variables

The treatment of list variables is cleaned up by improving their
assimilation in meta-explode. This has made it possible to have fewer
compiler components be aware of list variables. If list variables in
concrete syntax quotations should be used as list variables outside
those quotations as well, they should have a \* suffix. See issue
STR-321.

Realization of this clean-up required a bugfix in implode-asfix and a
change in the assimilation of concrete syntax, which entails that
Conc(ts1,ts2) is now used as a special constructor to denote the
concatenation of two lists. In particular, if Conc(ts1,ts2) is used in a
build, this is interpreted as (ts1, ts2). In other words Conc, cannot be
used as a normal constructor.

(Eelco Visser)

### []{#Translation_Scheme_I_Represent_F} Translation Scheme I: Represent Failure by NULL

The back-end of the compiler uses a new translation scheme. The old
scheme used the C feature of setjmp/longjmp to deal with failing
transformations. This provided the opportunity to go from using C as an
assembly language, where an entire Stratego program was compiled to a
single C function using gotos for control-flow, to a more idiomatic
style of C programs in which each strategy definition was compiled to a
C function. The setjmp/longjmp feature elegantly dealt with the notion
of a failure by declaring a choice point (with setjmp) and jumping to it
from anywhere (with longjmp). However, since choice points are the
control-flow mechanism in Stratego, the speed of programs depends
heavily on the cost of this feature. On Intel machinery (running Linux)
this is not a big issue, but on Apples and Suns (RISC machines) the
number of registers saved at each choicepoint is quite expensive; at
least that is a theory about possibilities for improving the performance
of Stratego programs.

Eelco Dolstra suggested a long time ago to return NULL to indicate
failure of a strategy. Indeed, this representation closely matches the
formal operational semantics of the language, in which the set of terms
is extended with a failure value; exactly the ATerm data-type extended
with an extra value (NULL).

The new translation scheme is pretty standard fair. Noteworthy about the
new version is the use of concrete syntax of Stratego and C almost
everywhere. For example, the following rule defines the translation of
the crucial guarded choice construct:

      TranslateStrat(|S,F) :

An interesting feature of the implementation is the collection of code
fragments using dynamic rules, and the synthesis of the target program
from these fragments afterwards; in contrast to the old method in which
the source program was traversed for each type of fragment \`driven by\'
the target program.

The new translation scheme is accompanied by a refactoring of the C code
of the run-time system and the native part of the Stratego Library.

(Eelco Visser)

[]{#Run_Time_System} Run-Time System
------------------------------------

Refactoring to support \`represent failure by NULL\' model.

(Eelco Visser)

[]{#Stratego_Library} Stratego Library
--------------------------------------

### []{#Native_code} Native code

Refactoring to support \`represent failure by NULL\' model.

(Eelco Visser)

Refactored native code of stratego-lib to reflect the structure and
order of the hierarchy of the Stratego part of the library. Removed
unused definitions.

(Rob Vermaas)

### []{#Stratego_code} Stratego code

The definition of collect-all with a skip has been adapted to recurse to
the current term instead of the children of current term in the case of
application of the skip strategy.

(Report by Ron de Bruijn, Fix by Martin Bravenboer)

The string concatenation strategy `conc-strings` now supports tuples of
more than 2 strings.

(Rob Vermaas)

[]{#Tools} Tools
----------------

### []{#Man_Pages} Man Pages

All Stratego/XT tools now have a manpage, which are installed on the
system of the user. The manpages are maintained in
[DocBook[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/Stratego/DocBook?topicparent=Stratego.StrategoRelease016M1)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"} as part of the Stratego/XT Manual, so
they are also available online.

(Karl Trygve Kalleberg)

### []{#GPP} [GPP](GPP){.twikiLink}

`pptable-diff` now takes the arity of constructors into account.

(Martin Bravenboer)

### []{#Stratego_regular} Stratego-regular

The implementation of `sig2rtg` was not compatible with the new Stratego
syntax. Since the tool does not seem to be used, migration has been
deferred.

(Eelco Visser)

### []{#pp_stratego} pp-stratego

The Stratego pretty printer is now a manually built pretty-printer
(using Stratego-Box language). The new pretty-printer should give a much
nicer output than the old pp-table approach.

(Rob Vermaas)

[]{#Stratego_XT_Deployment_and_Build} Stratego/XT Deployment and Build System
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#New_versions_of_ATerm_Library_an} New versions of ATerm Library and [SDF](SDF){.twikiLink} Packages
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stratego/XT 0.16 requires new versions of the ATerm library (2.4) and
sdf2-bundle (2.3.2). Downloads for these packages are available from the
Stratego/XT 0.16 release page.

It is no longer necessary to configure the ATerm library with the option
`--with-gcc`.

Also, it is no longer necessary to specifiy the locations of the ATerm
Library and sdf2-bundle to Stratego/XT. Stratego/XT will locate the
packages using pkg-config if you do not explicitly specify locations for
these packages.

[]{#AutoXT} [AutoXT](AutoXT){.twikiLink}
----------------------------------------

Makefile.xt now supports the STRCFLAGS variable. The old SCFLAGS
variable is still supported.

The Autoconf macro XT\_USE\_XT\_PACKAGES now supports a mixture of
explicit configuration and searching for packages with pkg-config. If
the user specifies a location of a package, then pkg-config will not be
used to search for the package.

The [AutoXT](AutoXT){.twikiLink} macros now set variables
pkg\_STRCFLAGS, where pkg is the name of the package. This variable
contains the include paths that have to be passed to the Stratego
compiler to be able to use that package. Packages can also pass other
arguments to strc using this variable, if necessary. This feature allows
dependent packages to abstract more of the way they need to use a
package. Hence, making the dependent packages more stable. The value of
pkg\_STRCFLAGS can be specified in the strcflags pkg-config variable. It
is inspired by the pkg\_CFLAGS and pkg\_LIBS feature of pkg-config.

The Autoconf macro XT\_CHECK\_STRATEGOXT\_UTILS now supports pkg-config
as well as explicit configuration.

(Martin Bravenboer)

### []{#Linking_Stratego_Libraries} Linking Stratego Libraries

For Stratego/XT 0.16, we have solved various linking issues on Mac OS X
and Cygwin.

First, the latest version of the ATerm Library (2.4) now creates a
dynamic library. Indirectly, this allows us to use dynamic linking of
the Stratego Library at Cygwin. This makes the executables, memory
consumption and the binary distribution for Cygwin much smaller.

Second, the dynamic ATerm Library solves a linking problem at Mac OS X
for very small Stratego programs.

Also, Stratego libraries now declare inter-library dependencies. This
means that all the indirectly required libraries are automatically added
as arguments to the linker. This is required for building dynamic
libraries at Cygwin and it might be useful for users that don\'t use
Makefile.xt or the stand-alone Stratego compiler.

### []{#Mac_OS_X_support_checked_in_buil} Mac OS X support checked in buildfarm

The improved performance of Stratego/XT on Mac OS X allows us to run a
full check of the Stratego/XT distribution on the Darwin machine in our
buildfarm. This will further improve the support of Stratego/XT for Mac
OS X.

### []{#Build_order_of_stratego_front_an} Build order of stratego-front and stratego-lib

The build order of stratego-front and stratego-lib has been swapped in
case of a baseline build. The modules in the library should be parsed
with the local syntax definition of Stratego, instead of the syntax
definition of the baseline. Since the library should be used with the
compiler in the current package, it should be compatible with that
compiler and use the same syntax definition. When bootstrapping
(building from a pre-compiled source tarball), the build-order is
reversed since the library is needed for the compilation of the
components in stratego-front. Also in the case of a bootstrap build, xtc
is built before stratego-front.
