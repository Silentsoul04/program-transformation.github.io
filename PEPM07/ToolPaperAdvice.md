Tool Paper Evaluation Criteria {#tool-paper-evaluation-criteria .twikiTopicTitle}
==============================

::: {.twikiWebTitle}
ACM SIGPLAN 2007 Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation
:::

PEPM has a special category of papers called tool demo papers. The main
purpose of a tool paper is to display other researchers in the PEPM
community a completed, robust and well-documented tool \-- highlighting
the overall functionality of the tool, the interfaces of the tool,
interesting examples and applications of the tool, an assessment of the
tool\'s strengths and weaknesses, and a summary of documentation/support
available with the tool.

Tool demo paper submissions must satisfy the following requirements.

-   The body of the paper must be no longer than 4 pages in length using
    the two-column ACM Conference style (found here). The body of the
    paper should give an overview of the tool, the methodology
    associated with its use, a summary of how the tool has been applied
    and to what effect, and it should indicate what supporting artifacts
    (user manual, example repository, downloads, etc) are available.
    This material will be included in the PEPM proceedings for accepted
    tool demos. The paper should include the following two items:
-   an appendix (limited to six pages) that gives an outline of the
    proposed demo presentation (this material will NOT appear in the
    PEPM proceedings), and
-   a URL to a web-site giving documentation and further information
    about the tool.

Because tool papers have a different format and a different purpose than
regular research papers, we would like to (a) describe in more detail
the characteristics of a good tool paper, and (b) give the explicit
evaluation criteria that will be used by the PEPM program committee when
selecting tool papers.

Regular research papers may also describe the details of a particular
tool, but note that there are important differences between the contents
of a tool demo paper and a research paper that describes a tool.
Research papers about tools clearly describe how aspects of the tool
(e.g., its architecture, underlying algorithms, combinations of
techniques, functionality, etc.) advance the state of the art. This
should include a detailed comparison with related work. Moreover,
research papers about tools should usually include the results/data of
experimental studies that rigorously demonstrate the effectiveness of
the claimed scientific advance. On the other hand, the main purpose of a
tool demo paper is not to rigorously justify the scientific advances of
the tool (although the tool demo paper may contain a concise list of
advances or references to other research papers). Rather, a tool demo
paper should simply provide concise summary of the current state of a
tool and describe how researchers in the PEPM community might apply it
effectively.

Below we list the explicit evaluation criteria that will be used by the
PEPM committee when selecting tool papers.

-   **Technical Foundations:** In keeping with the overall goals of
    PEPM, described tools should be based on well-reasoned semantic
    principles. Even though the shorter length of tool papers will not
    allow authors to provide significant technical details of the theory
    underlying the tool, submissions should give a concise summary of
    the technical foundations and provide references to related work
    where more technical details are presented.
-   **Novelty:** In contrast with regular PEPM submissions, PEPM tool
    demo papers may include work that has been published elsewhere. In
    the ideal case, the technical foundations of the tool will have been
    published previously, and the submitted PEPM tool paper will report
    on follow-on work that has produced a robust tool that has been
    applied to interesting examples. The PEPM program committee will
    consider accepting tool demo papers that describe tools that have
    been demo\'ed at other conferences/workshops if these
    conferences/workshops belong to a different community. For example,
    if a tool has been demo\'ed at an operating system conference, the
    PEPM program committee might also consider accepting the same tool
    to be demo\'ed at PEPM if it is determined that the demo could
    provide interesting and new insights to the PEPM community. If tool
    demo papers are submitted for tools that have demo\'ed elsewhere,
    authors should include a statement in the paper that acknowledges
    previous demos and that justifies what the benefits would be for
    presenting the tool again for the PEPM audience. In summary, the
    \"novelty\" expected of a tool demo paper is not \"never been
    published before or presented elsewhere\", but instead \"new useful
    and practical information provided to the PEPM community\".
-   **Stability:** PEPM tool demo papers should describe tools with
    reasonably complete implementations. Tools where significant
    components are not fully implemented or tested and tools which have
    not been applied to interesting examples will not be considered. It
    is expected that tool demos will describe well-engineered internal
    architectures and interfaces.
-   **Robustness:** Tool demo papers will also be evaluated for evidence
    of tool robustness. This might include evidence that the tool has
    been applied to a variety of examples, or used by others outside of
    the research group that developed the tools.
-   **Documentation:** Tools to be demoed should also be presented on a
    web-site that includes documentation for installation and a user
    manual that describes the basic use of the tool, its options, and
    its application to at least on example.
-   **Example Repository:** Ideally, tools should include a repository
    of examples (e.g., contained in the tool distribution or available
    on the tool web site) along with a description of how to run the
    tool on the examples.
-   **Publicly Availability:** Preference will be given to tools that
    are freely available (e.g., downloadable from the tool web site) so
    that other researchers in the PEPM community can independently
    evaluate the tool. Exceptions may be made for tools from industry
    and commercial tools that cannot be made publicly available for
    business reasons.
-   **Interesting Public Presentation:** Evaluation of tool demo papers
    will include an assessment of the potential quality of the tool demo
    (e.g., completeness of tool implementation, depth of functionality,
    quality of user interfaces, application and assessment of
    interesting examples) as presented in the attached appendix
    described above that outlines the demo session.

Authors with further questions about the structure, contents, or
suitability of a potential tool demo paper should contact the program
chairs.
