ACM SIGPLAN 2007 Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation
:::

The PEPM Symposium/Workshop series aims to bring together researchers
and practitioners working in the areas of program manipulation, partial
evaluation, and program generation. PEPM focuses on techniques, theory,
tools, and applications of analysis and manipulation of programs.

The 2007 PEPM workshop will be based on a broad interpretation of
semantics-based program manipulation and continue last year\'s
successful effort to expand the scope of PEPM significantly beyond the
traditionally covered areas of partial evaluation and specialization and
include practical applications of program transformations such as
refactoring tools, and practical implementation techniques such as
rule-based transformation systems. In addition, the scope of PEPM covers
manipulation and transformations of program and system representations
such as structural and semantic models that occur in the context of
model-driven development. In order to reach out to practitioners, a
separate category of tool demonstration papers will be solicited.

Topics of interest for PEPM\'07 include, but are not limited to:

-   Program and model manipulation techniques such as transformations
    driven by rules, patterns, or analyses, partial evaluation,
    specialization, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring, aspect
    weaving, decompilation, and obfuscation.

<!-- -->

-   Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model
    manipulation such as abstract interpretation, static analysis,
    binding-time analysis, dynamic analysis, constraint solving, and
    type systems.

<!-- -->

-   Analysis and transformation for programs/models with advanced
    features such as objects, generics, ownership types, aspects,
    reflection, XML type systems, component frameworks, and middleware.

<!-- -->

-   Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including
    meta-programming, generative programming, staged computation, and
    model-driven program generation and transformation.

<!-- -->

-   Application of the above techniques including experimental studies,
    engineering needed for scalability, and benchmarking. Examples of
    application domains include legacy program understanding and
    transformation, domain-specific language implementations, scientific
    computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for
    distributed and web-based applications, resource-limited
    computation, and security.

We especially encourage papers that break new ground including
descriptions of how program/model manipulation tools can be integrated
into realistic software development processes, descriptions of robust
tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications, and new
areas of application such as rapidly evolving systems, distributed and
webbased programming including middleware manipulation, model-driven
development, and on-the-fly program adaptation driven by run-time or
sttistical analysis.\
