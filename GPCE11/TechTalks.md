We are pleased to announce that GPCE 2011 will be featuring 2 excellent
tech talks.

\

### []{#Tech_Talk_1_Pragmatics_for_Forma} Tech Talk 1: Pragmatics for Formal Semantics

##### []{#http_cs_au_dk_danvy_Olivier_Danv}[]{#_http_cs_au_dk_danvy_Olivier_Dan} [Olivier Danvy](http://cs.au.dk/~danvy/)

###### []{#Abstract} Abstract

This tech talk describes how to write and how to inter-derive formal
semantics for sequential programming languages. The progress reported
here is (1) concrete guidelines to write each formal semantics to
alleviate their proof obligations, and (2) simple calculational tools to
obtain a formal semantics from another.

*Hands-on talk, bring your laptop!*

### []{#Tech_Talk_2_Theorem_based_Circui} Tech Talk 2: Theorem-based Circuit Derivation in Cryptol

##### []{#http_corp_galois_com_john_launch}[]{#_http_corp_galois_com_john_launc} [John Launchbury](http://corp.galois.com/john-launchbury/)

###### []{#Abstract} Abstract

Even though step-by-step refinement has long been seen as desirable, it
is hard to find compelling industrial applications of the technique. In
theory, transforming a high-level specification into a high-performance
implementation is an ideal means of producing a correct design, but in
practice it is hard to make it work, and even harder to make it
worthwhile. This talk describes an exception.

We introduce the domain-specific language, Cryptol, and work up to a
design experience in which theorem-based refinement played a crucial
role in producing an industrial quality FPGA encryptor and decryptor for
AES. Quite simply, we are unlikely to have succeeded without the
technique.

The Cryptol specification language was designed by Galois for the NSA as
a public standard for specifying cryptographic algorithms. A Cryptol
reference specification can serve as the formal documentation for a
cryptographic module, eliminating the need for separate and voluminous
English descriptions. Cryptol is fully executable, allowing designers to
experiment with their programs incrementally as their designs evolve.
Cryptol compilers can generate C, C++, and Haskell software
implementations, and VHDL or Verilog HDL hardware implementations. These
generators can significantly reduce overall life-cycle costs of
cryptographic solutions. For example, Cryptol allows engineers and
mathematicians to program cryptographic algorithms on FPGAs as if they
were writing software.

The design experience we describe runs as follows: we begin with a
specification for AES written in Cryptol, and over a series of five
design stages we produce an industrial grade encrypt core. In each
stage, we state theorems which relate the component behaviors in one
stage with the corresponding behaviors in the refinement. The resulting
cores, running at 350Mhz-440Mhz depending on the FPGA part, bear little
relationship to the original, except that the step-by-step theorems
ensured we had not gone astray.

We then repeat the pattern in generating a circuit for AES decrypt.
While there are many similarities between encrypt and decrypt in AES,
there are some crucial differences with regard to high performance.
First concerns the generation of key material. The AES key is used as a
seed for a specific pseudo-random number generator which produces key
material for use in each of the AES rounds. For encrypt, the
key-generator runs in sync with the action of encryption, so may be
scheduled alongside it. For decrypt, they run counter to one-another,
creating a major challenge to be overcome. Second, the generated key
material has an additional transformation applied to it, which occurs
deep in the middle of the high performing core.

Using theorems as stepping stones along the way, we redesign the key
expansion algorithm so that it will run in sync with the decryption. We
then trace parallel steps to the derivation of encrypt, establishing a
series of commuting diagrams along the way. Whenever we confronted bugs
in the development process, we produced many theorems to isolate the
bugs, using theorems as a principled kind of printf. When the bugs were
found and eradicated, we elided many of the temporary theorems, leaving
behind those that provided important insights into the behavior of the
code.

This talk is a story of the journey with demonstrations of the tool at
work. Its ultimate message is to highlight the value of including a
theorem facility within purely functional domain-specific languages.

[Dr. John Launchbury](http://corp.galois.com/john-launchbury/) is Chief
Scientist of Galois, Inc. John founded Galois in 1999 to address
challenges in Information Assurance through the application of
Functional Programming and Formal Methods. Under his leadership,
formerly as CEO, the company has grown strongly, successfully winning
and delivering on multiple contract awards for more than a decade. John
continues to lead Galois\' growing stature for its thought leadership in
high assurance technology development.

Prior to founding Galois, John was a full professor in Computer Science
and Engineering at the Oregon Graduate Institute School of Science and
Engineering at OHSU. His instruction style earned him several awards for
outstanding teaching, and he is internationally recognized for his work
on the analysis and semantics of programming languages, and on the
Haskell programming language in particular. John received First Class
Honors in Mathematics from Oxford University in 1985. He holds a Ph.D.
in Computing Science from University of Glasgow and won the British
Computer Society\'s distinguished dissertation prize. In 2010, John was
inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)\
