### []{#Workshop_Chair} Workshop Chair

\* Ulrik P. Schultz, University of Southern Denmark

The workshop chair can be contacted at <workshops07@gpce.org>

### []{#Important_Dates} Important Dates

Workshop proposal schedule:

\* Submission deadline for workshop proposals: **Friday March 16th** \*
Date for notification of workshop acceptance: Monday April 9th

This call is for workshop organizers; a later call will occur for
workshop contributions.

### []{#Overview} Overview

GPCE workshops provide intensive collaborative environments where
generative and component technology researchers and practitioners meet
to discuss and solve challenging problems facing the field.

We encourage proposals for innovative, well-focused workshops on a broad
spectrum of component engineering and generative programming topics. All
topics related to the theme of the conference are potential candidates
for workshops. Workshops typically fall into the following categories:

\* A workshop may address a specific sub-area of generative and
component technology in depth. \* A workshop may cover areas that cross
the borders of several sub areas. Workshops that cross the borders of
the formal and the applied areas is one example. \* A workshop may also
cross the border to other technologies or software engineering fields,
e.g. development processes. \* A workshop may focus on the application
and deployment of generative and/or component technology in areas such
as telecommunications, mobile computing or real-time systems. Workshops
reporting on industrial experiences are particularly welcome.

Workshop topics are by no means limited to the categories mentioned
above. However, in each case, the proposed area is supposed to have
enough impetus to yield new results that can be considered important and
worth more detailed investigation.

### []{#Submission_Format} Submission Format

Workshop proposals should be sent in ASCII or PDF format to the workshop
chairs and should consist of the following four parts:

1\. Cover Page \* Name of the proposed workshop. \* Names and addresses
of the organizers. \* Primary contact. \* Intended number of
participants. \* Requested Audio/Video equipment.

2\. Abstract \* Why is the proposed workshop relevant to GPCE? The
abstract should provide a short overview of the rationale for the
workshop and the major topics. In particular, statements about the
review process and ways to ensure creativity during the workshop would
be appreciated. \* The abstract should preferably not exceed 200 words.

3\. Call for Participation \* A preliminary version of the Call for
Participation that the organizers must prepare if the workshop is
accepted. \* The call for participation should provide a brief overview
of the proposed workshop, including a description of the goals of the
workshops and the work practices. \* The call may repeat some of the
statements made on the abstract page, but should be targeted
specifically to potential workshop participants.

4\. Organizers Bio and Past Events \* Short biography of each organizer.
\* References to similar workshops organized at previous conferences,
including the number of participants.

If a workshop is accepted, the organizers will be requested to prepare a
web page that will contain the latest information about the workshop.
The web pages of each workshop will be linked to from the GPCE workshop
web site. Each workshop must have at least two organizers, preferably
from different organizations.

Please keep complete submissions to under four pages.

### []{#Recommendations} Recommendations

1\. Workshop organizers should foster the creative potential that is
tentatively present in a workshop.

2\. Remember that a workshop is NOT a conference!

3\. The success of a workshop depends greatly on the results generated
on-site.

4\. A number of interrelated issues should be taken into account in order
to provide a good framework for such on-site creativity.

5\. Presentation selection \* Quality should obviously be the primary
criterion for selecting the presentations. \* However, in order for a
workshop to be productive, consider also having presentations on some
new, controversial topics to spark discussion.

Workshop attendance will be manage via the GPCE registration form.
Workshop organizers and presenters are required to register to the
workshop.

### []{#Submission_Process} Submission Process

Electronic submission of proposals must be sent to
<workshops07@gpce.org>. Proposals must be submitted no later than
**March 16th**, BUT EARLIER IS BETTER, as it allows for a more
satisfactory coordination between workshop proposals.

The submitted proposals will be reviewed collectively by the Workshop
Committee to determine a high quality and appropriate mix for the
conference.

### []{#For_More_Information} For More Information

For additional information, clarification, or questions please feel free
to contact the Workshop Chair (<workshops07@gpce.org>).
