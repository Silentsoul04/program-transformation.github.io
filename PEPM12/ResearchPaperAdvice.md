Advice on Writing a PEPM Research Paper {#advice-on-writing-a-pepm-research-paper .twikiTopicTitle}
=======================================

::: {.twikiWebTitle}
ACM SIGPLAN 2012 Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation
:::

The PEPM Symposium/Workshop series aims to bring together researchers
and practitioners working in the broad area of program transformation
and generation. We hope that PEPM authors will find the following advice
helpful in preparing their submissions. The suggestions are based on the
guidelines for PEPM 2006 submissions. Tool demonstration papers have
special requirements, described in
[ToolPaperAdvice](ToolPaperAdvice){.twikiLink}.

### []{#Program_Goals} Program Goals

The topics covered by PEPM are listed in the Call for Papers. Please
contact one of the program chairs if you have further questions about
PEPM\'s scope.

### []{#Original_Work} Original Work

All papers should be original work, and not have been previously
published nor have been submitted to, or be in consideration for, any
journal, book, conference, or workshop. The novelty requirement is
relaxed for [Tool Demonstration Papers](ToolPaperAdvice){.twikiLink}.

### []{#Commendable_Qualities} Commendable Qualities

-   **Clear contributions:** The contributions of the paper should be
    stated explicitly in the introduction of the paper and elaborated in
    the rest of it. Limitations should be acknowledged; if possible,
    future work should mention the ways to overcome these limitations.
-   **Well-written:** In particular, the authors should strive to make
    the paper free from spelling and grammatical mistakes.
-   **Good examples:** Every major point should be illustrated with an
    example.
-   **Well-supported claims:** Any claims of performance improvements,
    ease of use, scalability, etc. must be justified by the appropriate
    evidence, such as computational cost analyses, benchmarks, usability
    studies, multiple case studies and so on.
-   **Relevant to real-world problems:** Authors should clearly indicate
    actual real-world scenarios in which they envision their work (when
    fully mature) being applied. Issues such as scalability, analysis
    precision, degree of automation, learning curve, etc. that might
    hinder the use of the technique in practice should be acknowledged
    and assessed.
-   **Properly positioned to related work:** Submissions should include
    a related work section that summarizes and contrasts with closely
    related work. Related work should not simply list previous papers
    with a brief summary of their contents, nor should it state only the
    strengths of the submission and the weakness of previous work. A
    proper related work section should state both the strengths and
    weaknesses of the submission and indicate situations in which one
    method might be preferred over another.
-   **Clear methodology and integration into larger development
    context:** Authors should clearly indicate the steps that users
    should go through to apply a technique including any manual
    preprocessing, tool configuration, assessment of output, etc.
    Moreover, an assessment of how the technique fits into the context
    of other development tools such as debuggers, test frameworks,
    integrated development environments, etc. For example, if the
    proposed technique is a generative programming technique in which
    users are not expected to read generated code, what mechanisms might
    be provided to aid debugging of generated code. In another case, how
    does the transformation interact with the use of library code? Is
    there any impact on how the system is tested?
-   **Supporting material:** If at all possible, the authors are
    encouraged to make examples, data, tools or other artifacts
    presented in the paper freely available online.

### []{#Common_Flaws} Common Flaws

-   **Lack of simple examples:** Every major point in the paper should
    be illustrated with an example. When introducing a new technique or
    analysis, it is wholly appropriate to use simple, well-known
    examples such as the \"power function\" and the \"dot product\".
-   **Lack of realistic examples:** The paper will hopefully claim that
    its technique and analyses scale to real-world problems. These
    claims should also be illustrated with an appropriate large example.
    If the example is too large to fully describe in the paper, the
    paper should give the highlights and refer to the complete
    explanation online: a web page, a technical report, or
    well-commented source code.
-   **Lack of clear correctness notions:** the authors should explicitly
    state what it means for their technique or analysis to be correct.
    For example, a paper on program transformation must state what
    properties of programs are preserved by the transformation. The
    authors should argue, perhaps informally, how their implementation
    or tool meets or approximates the correctness properties, or give a
    clear statement of the pre-conditions for the successful application
    of the technique. Detailed proofs need not be included in the
    submission but may be referred to in a URL or a technical report.
-   **Lack of clear methodology:** Many papers present techniques
    without telling what the users have to do, step-by-step, to apply
    the techniques. Issues such as initial binding-time improvement or
    refactoring of source code, stubbing out or annotating library
    methods, etc. are often ignored. As a classic example, many early
    PEPM papers \"swept under the rug\" the need for manual binding-time
    improvements and annotations. As the result, non-experts have had
    significant trouble applying partial evaluation techniques in
    practice.
-   **Poor related work comparisons:** Papers often suffer from poor
    related work comparisons in which authors follow a pattern \"our
    tool is better at TASK-X than tool T1 because \..., our tool is
    better at TASK-Y than tool T2 because \...\" (all the while ignoring
    the fact that tool T1 has a much broader scope than the authors\'
    tool or that it is in fact better than the authors\' tool for many
    aspects not mentioned in the paper). Authors should strive to give a
    balanced and fair assessment listing both strengths and weakness of
    all work considered.

### []{#Example_Paper_Types} Example Paper Types

-   **New transformation technique:** The most common type of PEPM paper
    will report on a new analysis/transformation technique. Such papers
    should include a detailed description of the technique, some sort of
    formal or informal argument about why the technique is correct,
    illustrate the technique on interesting examples, and evaluate the
    effectiveness of the technique.
-   **Case studies:** This type of paper reports on a large-scale
    application of an existing technique. Such papers should clearly
    state the insights and the lessons of the study. Was the technique
    effective? Was it easy to apply? What pitfalls were overcome and
    what difficulties remain? One must clearly distinguish anecdotal
    performance claims from rigorously established ones.
-   **Description of new/interesting domain and potential for effective
    use of PEPM techniques:** This type of paper describes a particular
    application domain (e.g., middleware, avionics systems, active
    networks) or a particular development paradigm (e.g., model-driven
    development) detailing how techniques within the scope of PEPM might
    be applied effectively in that domain. Special attention should be
    given to enumerating the problems/challenges of the domain,
    characteristics that suggest that it might benefit from PEPM
    techniques, initial attempts at applying those techniques, and
    questions/challenges to be addressed by future work. Such papers
    should aim to educate the PEPM community about
    interesting/fundamental issues of the domain, and give pointers to
    where they may learn more about the issues.

### []{#Short_papers} Short papers

We do encourage submissions of \"work in progress\" in cases where the
submission raises issues that will generate interesting discussions at
the meeting, brings new knowledge of a particular application domain or
technique to the community, or lays out challenging open problems of
high relevance to software engineering practice. Depending on the
quality and number of such submissions, we may collect work-in-progress
papers into a single session with slightly shorter time slots for each
presentation and a longer discussion time at the end of the session.
