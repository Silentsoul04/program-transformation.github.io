The following contributions were selected (out of 15 submissions) for
presentation at the workshop:

    Schürr](http://www.es.tu-darmstadt.de). **Complex Attribute
    Manipulation in TGGs with Constraint-Based Programming
    Techniques.**\
    \
    **Abstract:** Model transformation plays a central role in
    Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and providing bidirectional
    transformation languages is a current challenge with important
    applications. Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs) are a formally founded,
    bidirectional model transformation language shown by numerous case
    studies to be quite promising and successful. Although TGGs provide
    adequate support for structural aspects via object patterns in
    production rules, support for handling complex relationships between
    different attributes is still missing in current implementations.
    For certain applications, such as bidirectional model-to-text
    transformations, being able to manipulate attributes via string
    manipulation or arithmetic operations in TGG production rules is
    vital. Our contribution in this paper is a novel TGG extension that
    provides a means for complex attribute manipulation in TGG
    production rules. Our extension is compatible with the existing TGG
    formalization, and retains the \"single specification\" philosophy
    of TGGs.

    Algebraic and Coalgebraic Descriptions of Lenses.**\
    \
    **Abstract:** Lenses are a heavily studied form of bidirectional
    transformation, with diverse applications including database view
    updating, software development and memory management. Previous work
    has explored lenses category-theoretically, and established that
    lenses are isomorphic to algebras for a particular monad on a slice
    category. It has recently been shown that lenses are the coalgebras
    for the comonad generated by cartesian closure. We present an
    equational proof of the coalgebra correspondence, note that the
    algebra correspondence extends to arbitrary categories with products
    and that the coalgebra correspondence extends to arbitrary cartesian
    closed categories, and show that both correspondences extend to
    isomorphisms of categories. The resulting isomorphism between a
    category of algebras and a category of coalgebras is unexpected, and
    we analyze it, isolating its underlying generality, and also the
    particularity that restricts its applicability.

    Types.**\
    \
    **Abstract:** Existing bidirectional languages are either
    state-based or operation-based, depending on wether they represent
    updates as mere states or as sequences of edit operations.
    In-between both worlds are delta-based frameworks, where updates are
    represented using alignment relationships between states. In this
    paper, we formalize delta lenses over inductive types using
    dependent type theory and develop a point-free delta lens language
    with an explicit separation of shape and data. In contrast with the
    already known issue of data alignment, we identify the new problem
    of shape alignment and solve it by lifting standard recursion
    patterns such as folds and unfolds to delta lenses that use
    alignment to infer meaningful shape updates.

-   [Vadim Zaytsev](http://grammarware.net). **Language Evolution,
    Metasyntactically.**\
    \
    **Abstract:** We use a formal specification for syntactic notations
    in order to simulate a scenario of notational evolution: a special
    language evolution case when the language itself is preserved, but
    the notation which is used to write down its grammar in the
    documentation, changes, and those changes need to be propagated to
    coupled grammar refactorings, grammarbase mutations and other
    connected artefacts. Both the megamodel and the prototypical
    implementation of this scenario are explained. They employ
    bidirectional grammar transformation for the purposes of adaptation
    and convergence, transformable notation specifications and coupled
    unidirectional grammar mutations.

    Rosebrugh](http://www.mta.ca/~rrosebru/). **Lens put-put
    laws:  Monotonic and mixed.**\
    \
    **Abstract:** Since the introduction of very well behaved lenses,
    several authors have argued, for good reasons, that in many
    applications the put-put law is too strong. On the other hand, the
    present authors have shown that such lenses, including the put-put
    law, are algebras for a certain monad, and that this viewpoint
    admits fruitful generalisations of the lens concept to a variety of
    base categories. In the algebra approach to lenses, the put-put law
    corresponds to the associativity axiom, and so is fundamentally
    important. Thus we have a dilemma. The put-put law seems
    inappropriate for a variety of applications, but is fundamental to
    the mathematical development that can support a range of
    applications. In this paper we resolve this dilemma. The put-put law
    as normally stated is indeed too strong when the category of models
    is non-trivial (not just a set of models). We describe monotonic
    put-put laws \-- those in which successive puts are, loosely
    speaking, both along deletes, or both along inserts, and note that
    such laws do not suffer the criticisms of the classical put-put law
    and incidentally provide a counterexample to the mistaken belief
    that the presence of put-put laws implies constant complement
    updating. Of course, of much greater interest than monotonic put-put
    laws are mixed put-put laws that treat together both inserts and
    deletes. The main contribution of this paper is the development and
    analysis of a new mixed put-put law which is very general, is indeed
    weaker than classical put-put, does not seem to be subject to the
    criticisms of the classical put-put law, and is sufficient to
    support the monad based mathematical treatment of generalised
    lenses.

    and Fernando Orejas. **Attribute Handling for Bidirectional Model
    Transformations: The Triple Graph Grammar Case.**\
    \
    **Abstract:** When describing bidirectional model transformations in
    a declarative (relational) way, the relation between structures in
    source and target models is specified. But not only structural
    correspondences between source and target models need to be
    described. Another important aspect is the specification of the
    relation between attribute values of elements in source and target
    models. However, existing approaches either do not allow such a
    relational kind of specification for attributes or allow it only in
    a restricted way. We consider the challenge of bridging the gap
    between a flexible declarative attribute specification and its
    operationalization for the triple graph grammar (TGG) specification
    technique as an important representative for describing
    bidirectional model transformations in a relational way. First, we
    present a formal way to specify attributes in TGG rules in a purely
    declarative (relational) way. Then, we give an overview of
    characteristic barriers that bidirectional model transformation tool
    developers are confronted with when operationalizing relational
    attribute constraints for different TGG application scenarios.
    Moreover, we present pragmatic solutions to overcome the
    operationalization barriers for different TGG application scenarios
    in our own TGG implementation.

    transformations meets dynamic updates: promise & perils.**\
    \
    **Abstract:** Dynamic updates that transform objects in an
    unidirectional manner face timing issues that might lead to run-time
    type errors. A way to avoid such run-time type errors is to keep
    both versions of objects and synchronize them with bidirectional
    transformations. Keeping objects synchronized this way raises some
    challenges in term of performance, thread safety, and practicality.
    We present implementation strategies and explore the solution space
    of such an approach. We put theoretical issues into perspective by
    considering results of existing empirical research in the field, and
    investigate the use of a simple bidirectional language to express
    object transformations. We conclude that this scheme can be made
    practical, and we sketch future research directions to reach this
    goal.

-   Perdita Stevens. **Observations relating to the equivalences induced
    on model sets by bidirectional transformations.**\
    \
    **Abstract:** A bidirectional transformation on a pair of sets of
    models induces two principal equivalence relations on each set of
    models. Since a model can be uniquely identified by specifying its
    equivalence class in each of these relations, they function as a
    coordinate system for the model sets, with respect to the
    transformation. We give a collection of results relating to this
    observation and explore the consequences for the study of the
    transformation.
