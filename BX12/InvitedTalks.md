=============

::: {.twikiWebTitle}
First International Workshop on Bidirectional Transformations (2012)
:::

We are proud to feature the following two invited talks:

-   [Juan de Lara](http://arantxa.ii.uam.es/~jlara/) (Autonomous
    University of Madrid, Spain): **Bidirectional Transformations with
    Graphical Constraints.** (joint talk with [GT-VMT
    2012](http://www.cem.brighton.ac.uk/gt-vmt12/))\
    \
    **Abstract:** Model Driven Engineering (MDE) is a software
    engineering paradigm that attacks the accidental complexity in the
    development process by increasing the abstraction level at which
    engineers work. In this way, models (in contrast to programs) are
    the core assets, and model transformations become first-class
    citizens. Still, most current transformation languages are directed
    to the implementation of model transformations, and little effort is
    currently devoted to support other phases of the transformation
    development, like requirements specification or testing.\
    In this talk, I will first present a formal language (called PAMOMO)
    for the specification of model transformations in a declarative,
    graphical, bidirectional way. The approach is based on patterns or
    constraints describing the allowed and forbidden relations between
    two models. Such specification can be compiled into operational
    mechanisms, based on Graph Transformation, to perform forward and
    backward transformations. The language has a general semantics,
    which makes it applicable to several scenarios and activities
    relevant for MDE, which will be explored in the second part of the
    talk.\
    First, PAMOMO can be used as a general framework supporting
    inter-modelling, which is the activity of building models that
    describe how other models should be related. This includes many
    common activities in MDE, like the specification of model-to-model
    transformations seen before, but also the definition of model
    matching and model traceability constraints, the development of
    inter-model consistency maintainers and exogenous model management
    operators. Second, PAMOMO can be used as a language for specifying
    transformation contracts, enabling the verification of
    transformations implemented with any transformation language. The
    verification can be performed by compiling the contracts either into
    OCL expressions, which can then be used as partial oracle functions,
    or into QVT Relations check-only transformations to detect
    disconformities of transformation results with respect to the
    contracts. Finally, the general bi-directional semantics of PAMOMO
    can be used as a basis to describe other languages, like QVT
    Relations.

    Hainaut](http://www.fundp.ac.be/universite/personnes/page_view/01000270/)
    (University of Namur, Belgium): **Bidirectional Transformations in
    Database Engineering.**\
    \
    **Abstract:** Most processes in database engineering consist in
    transforming schemas according to definite requirements. Basically,
    a schema transformation is a rewriting rule that allows schema
    constructs to be replaced by other constructs that are expected to
    better meet these requirements. Schema normalization, logical
    design, schema integration, view derivation, proving schema
    equivalence, data conversion, database reverse engineering, database
    evolution, schema optimization, ETL, wrapper generation are some
    popular database related processes that can be modelled as schema
    transformations.\
    In most cases, schemas have instances, so that parallel data
    transformation rules are associated with schema transformations in
    order to adapt the contents of the source database to the new target
    schema. A transformation is qualified semantics-preserving, or
    bidirectional, if there exists an inverse transformation through
    which the source database (schema and instances) can be recovered
    from the target database. This class of transformations are
    important in that they guarantee the preservation of information
    capacity of the source database through an arbitrary chain of
    transformations. For instance, describing the database design
    process as a bidirectional transformation ensures that all the user
    requirements expressed by the conceptual schema have been translated
    into the physical database. Conversely, modeling database reverse
    engineering as a chain of (mostly) bidirectional transformations
    helps in recovering the hidden intended semantics of a physical
    database.\
    In this talk, we briefly recall the principles of database
    engineering as a specific domain of complex software systems
    engineering. We then describe basic and practical aspects of
    database transformation techniques including their properties of
    semantics preservation. Major database engineering activities are
    redefined in terms of transformation techniques, and the impact on
    CASE technology is discussed and illustrated.
