### []{#CALL_FOR_WORKSHOP_PROPOSALS} CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seventh International Conference on

**Generative Programming and Component Engineering (GPCE\'08)**

[![ACM

[![ACM
logo](../pub/GPCE08/ConferenceHeader/acm_logo.jpg)](http://www.acm.org/)
**October 19-23, 2008**\
**Nashville, Tennessee**\
(co-located with [OOPSLA 2008](http://www.oopsla.org/oopsla2008/))\

Sponsored by ACM [SIGPLAN](http://www.acm.org/sigplan/), in cooperation
with ACM [SIGSOFT](http://www.acm.org/sigsoft/).\
GPCE\'08 proceedings published by [ACM Press](http://www.acm.org/pubs/).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### []{#Important_Dates} Important Dates

\* Proposal submission deadline for tutorial proposals: **March 20,
2008** \* Date for notification of acceptance: **April 5, 2008**

This call is for workshop organizers. Each accepted workshop will
publish a separate call for contributions.

### []{#Overview} Overview

GPCE workshops provide intensive collaborative environments where
generative and component technology researchers and practitioners meet
to discuss and solve challenging problems facing the field. All topics
related to the theme of the conference are potential candidates for
workshops.

Workshops typically fall into the following categories:

\* A workshop may address a specific sub-area of generative and
component technology in depth. \* A workshop may cover areas that cross
the borders of several sub areas. Workshops that cross the borders of
the formal and the applied areas is one example. \* A workshop may also
cross the border to other technologies or software engineering fields,
e.g. development processes. \* A workshop may focus on the application
and deployment of generative and/or component technology in areas such
as telecommunications, mobile computing or real-time systems. Workshops
reporting on industrial experiences are particularly welcome.

Workshop topics are by no means limited to the categories mentioned
above. However, in each case, the proposed area is supposed to have
enough impetus to yield new results that can be considered important and
worth more detailed investigation. If you have an idea for an
innovative, well-focused workshop on some aspects of component
engineering and generative programming topics, please consider
submitting a proposal.

#### []{#Topics} Topics

GPCE seeks contributions in software engineering and in programming
languages related (but not limited) to:

\* Generative programming \* Reuse, meta-programming, partial
evaluation, multi-stage and multi-level languages, step-wise refinement,
and generic programming \* Semantics, type systems, symbolic
computation, linking and explicit substitution, in-lining and macros,
templates, and program transformation \* Runtime code generation,
compilation, active libraries, synthesis from specifications,
development methods, generation of non-code artifacts, formal methods,
and reflection \* Generative techniques for \* Product-line
architectures \* Distributed, real-time and embedded systems \*
Model-driven development and architecture \* Resource bounded/safety
critical systems. \* Component-based software engineering \*Reuse,
distributed platforms and middleware, distributed systems, evolution,
patterns, development methods, deployment and configuration techniques,
and formal methods \* Integration of generative and component-based
approaches \* Domain engineering and domain analysis \* Domain-specific
languages including visual and UML-based DSLs \* Separation of concerns
\* Aspect-oriented and feature-oriented programming, \* Intentional
programming and multi-dimensional separation of concerns \* Industrial
applications of the above

### []{#Co_location_with_OOPSLA} Co-location with OOPSLA

The technical program of GPCE will start on Sunday, October 19, 2008.
The technical program of OOPSLA (that is, the technical paper sessions)
will start on Tuesday, October 21, 2008. GPCE satellite events will
either be scheduled concurrently with the GPCE technical program or
concurrently with the OOPSLA main technical program. As such, attendance
will be more convenient than in the case of a model where extra days are
allocated before or after the main technical conference program.
However, the satellite events will also receive competition for
attendance in this way.

### []{#Submission_Format} Submission Format

Workshop proposals should be sent in ASCII or PDF format to the workshop
chairs and should consist of the following four parts:

1\. Cover Page \* Name of the proposed workshop. \* Names and addresses
of the organizers. \* Primary contact. \* Intended number of
participants. \* Requested Audio/Video equipment.

2\. Abstract \* Why is the proposed workshop relevant to GPCE? The
abstract should provide a short overview of the rationale for the
workshop and the major topics. In particular, statements about the
review process and ways to ensure creativity during the workshop would
be appreciated. \* The abstract should preferably not exceed 200 words.

3\. Call for Participation \* A preliminary version of the Call for
Participation that the organizers must prepare if the workshop is
accepted. \* The call for participation should provide a brief overview
of the proposed workshop, including a description of the goals of the
workshops and the work practices. \* The call may repeat some of the
statements made on the abstract page, but should be targeted
specifically to potential workshop participants.

4\. Organizers Bio and Past Events \* Short biography of each organizer.
\* References to similar workshops organized at previous conferences,
including the number of participants.

If a workshop is accepted, the organizers will be requested to prepare a
web page that will contain the latest information about the workshop.
The web pages of each workshop will be linked to from the GPCE workshop
web site. Each workshop must have at least two organizers, preferably
from different organizations.

Please keep complete submissions to under four pages.

### []{#Recommendations} Recommendations

1\. Workshop organizers should foster the creative potential that is
tentatively present in a workshop.

2\. Remember that a workshop is NOT a conference!

3\. The success of a workshop depends greatly on the results generated
on-site.

4\. A number of interrelated issues should be taken into account in order
to provide a good framework for such on-site creativity.

5\. Presentation selection \* Quality should obviously be the primary
criterion for selecting the presentations. \* However, in order for a
workshop to be productive, consider also having presentations on some
new, controversial topics to spark discussion.

Workshop attendance will be managed via the GPCE registration form.

Workshop organizers and presenters are required to register to the
workshop.

### []{#Submission_Process} Submission Process

Proposals must be submitted electronically (in .pdf format) to
<workshops08@gpce.org>. The submission deadline is **March 20, 2008**,
but early submission is strongly encouraged. All proposals will be
reviewed by the Chair for GPCE Satellite Events and by members of the
GPCE Program Committee to ensure a high quality and an appropriate mix
of topics so that the combined program of satellite events attracts a
large interest among the various segments within the broad GPCE
community.

### []{#Contact} Contact

For additional information, clarification, or questions please feel free
to contact the Chair for GPCE Satellite Events (Ralf Lämmel,
<workshops08@gpce.org>).
