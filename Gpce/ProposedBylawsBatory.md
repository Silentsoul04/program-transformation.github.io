Generative Programming: Concepts and Experience
:::

The International Conference on Generative Programming and Component
Engineering (GPCE) Bylaws

Aim

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Program generation techniques have the potential to revolutionize
software development as automation and components revolutionized
manufacturing. The abundance of current research in this area indicates
that there are many technical problems both at the foundational and
engineering levels.

There is wealth of methods in approaching problems from different
backgrounds, and a wide spectrum of application domains were program
generation techniques appear valuable. This diversity may lead to
unnecessary fragmentation in the research community.

The major aim of GPCE is to foster the creation of a bridge community,
in addition to communities with more specific interests.

The organizational structure of GPCE consists of a single Steering
Committee whose aim is to promote the coherent aggregation of related
events.

Affiliation with ACM and IFIP

------------------------------------------------------------------------

GPCE will seek the sponsorship of the ACM whenever possible.

In additional to its independent standing as a conference, GPCE also
serves as the working conference for the IFIP Working Group on Program
Generation, WG 2.11.

Steering Committee

------------------------------------------------------------------------

GPCE takes place yearly, in the August to October period (typically
Sep-Oct). For the purposes of the following, a year ends on the date of
conclusion of the calendar year\'s GPCE conference.

The Steering Committe (SC) is limited to SIX members. **{ADD - Each
member can serve for at most 5 years.}** In normal circumstances, each
year the oldest member leaves the SC, and is replaced by a new person.

A decision is deemed approved by the SC by majority rule; votes that end
in ties are not approved.

**{A.1 CURRENT - The person serving the 5th year of membership is
committee chair for that year}{A.2 NEW - The SC votes one of its members
SC chair, with a 2 year mandate.}**.

The SC chair is the official representative of the SC within GPCE and
the official interface between the SC and the outside world. The chair
is expected to lead the discussion within the SC and coordinate the
activities of the SC.

Incoming SC members are chosen by SC decision among: \* the General
Chairs (GCs) of the last 3 GPCE conferences \* the Program Chairs (PCs)
of the last 3 GPCE conferences In special circumstances (namely
bootstrapping: not enough eligible persons per above rules) the current
SC is allowed to select members outside the above categories.

**{B.1 CURRENT - When a person leaves the SC, by default all people in
the SC with earlier rank are promoted, so that the newest person will
have least seniority. The default may be altered by an SC decision. But
under no circumstances will a SC member serve more than 5 years in a
single appointment.}{B.2 NEW - drop this part}**

The SC (based on the ACM guidelines) is responsible for \* specifying
the duties of the SC including changes to the bylaws \* setup rules for
appointing the GPCE GC and PC (and other persons involved in the
organization of one edition of GPCE), and specifying their duties \*
making decisions on matters that have a lasting consequences on GPCE
conference, such as: the scope, topics of interests, publication venues
\* making decisions on information sharing infrastructures to promote
interaction and dissemination of ideas in the GPCE community, such as
mailing lists, repositories, web sites. \* appointing the GPCE Publicity
Chair or other persons involved in the organization of several editions
of GPCE (or in managing the information sharing infrastructures), and
specifying their duties

Business Meetings

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each GPCE conference should schedule a Business Meeting (BM), which is
public and conducted by the SC chair (or a deputy from the SC). The BM
is a way to provide information to and get feedback from the GPCE
community. The BM typically includes the following items: \* a report on
the current GPCE conference \* an announcement of next year\'s GPCE
conference \* offers from potential host for the GPCE in two years
Proposals for additional items should be brought to the attention of SC
members at least two months in advance of the BM, but a limited time for
raising unanticipated issues is always granted. The agenda of the BM
will be finalized at least one month in advance.

During the BM a show of hands could be taken on specific issues, but the
result is not binding for the SC.\
