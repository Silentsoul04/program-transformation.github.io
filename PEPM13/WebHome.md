The PEPM Symposium/Workshop series aims at bringing together researchers
and practitioners working in the areas of program manipulation, partial
evaluation, and program generation. PEPM focuses on techniques, theory,
tools, and applications of analysis and manipulation of programs.

The 2013 PEPM workshop will be based on a broad interpretation of
semantics-based program manipulation and continue last years\'
successful effort to expand the scope of PEPM significantly beyond the
traditionally covered areas of partial evaluation and specialization and
include practical applications of program transformations such as
refactoring tools, and practical implementation techniques such as
rule-based transformation systems. In addition, the scope of PEPM covers
manipulation and transformations of program and system representations
such as structural and semantic models that occur in the context of
model-driven development. In order to reach out to practitioners, a
separate category of tool demonstration papers will be solicited.

Topics of interest for PEPM\'13 include, but are not limited to:

-   Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation,
    partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active
    libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution,
    refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation.

<!-- -->

-   Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model
    manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking,
    binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated
    testing and test case generation.

<!-- -->

-   Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including
    metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific
    languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming,
    staged computation, and model-driven program generation and
    transformation.

<!-- -->

-   Application of the above techniques including case studies of
    program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source)
    projects and software development processes, descriptions of robust
    tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications,
    benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy program
    understanding and transformation, DSL implementations, visual
    languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, middleware
    frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and web-based
    applications, resource-limited computation, and security.

To maintain the dynamic and interactive nature of PEPM, we will continue
the category of \`short papers\' for tool demonstrations and for
presentations of exciting if not fully polished research, and of
interesting academic, industrial and open-source applications that are
new or unfamiliar.

Student attendants with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC
grant to help cover travel expenses and other support. PAC also offers
other support, such as for child-care expenses during the meeting or for
travel costs for companions of SIGPLAN members with physical
disabilities, as well as for travel from locations outside of North
America and Europe. For details on the PAC programme, see its [web
page](http://www.sigplan.org/PAC.htm).

All accepted papers, short papers included, will appear in formal
proceedings published by ACM Press. In addition to printed proceedings,
accepted papers will be included in the [ACM Digital
Library](http://portal.acm.org/dl.cfm). Selected papers will be invited
for a journal special issue of Science of Computer Programming dedicated
to PEPM\'13.

PEPM has established a Best Paper award. The winner will be announced at
the workshop.

Authors must transfer copyright to ACM upon acceptance (for government
work, to the extent transferable), but retain various rights. Authors
are encouraged to publish auxiliary material with their paper (source
code, test data, etc.); they retain copyright of auxiliary material. The
[SIGPLAN Republication
Policy](http://www.sigplan.org/republicationpolicy.htm) and [ACM\'s
Policy and Procedures on
Plagiarism](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy)
apply.

Papers](CallForPapers){.twikiLink}. There is also a more compact
