ACM SIGPLAN 2010 Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation
:::

The PEPM Symposium/Workshop series aims to bring together researchers
and practitioners working in the areas of program manipulation, partial
evaluation, and program generation. PEPM focuses on techniques,
theories, tools, and applications of analysis and manipulation of
programs.

The 2010 PEPM workshop will be based on a broad interpretation of
semantics-based program manipulation in a continued effort to expand the
scope of PEPM significantly beyond the traditionally covered areas of
partial evaluation and specialization and include practical applications
of program transformations such as refactoring tools, and practical
implementation techniques such as rule-based transformation systems. In
addition, it covers manipulation and transformations of program and
system representations such as structural and semantic models that occur
in the context of model-driven development. In order to reach out to
practitioners, there is a separate category of tool demonstration
papers.

Topics of interest for PEPM\'10 include, but are not limited to:

-   Program and model manipulation techniques such as transformations
    driven by rules, patterns, or analyses, partial evaluation,
    specialization, program inversion, program composition, slicing,
    symbolic execution, refactoring, aspect weaving, decompilation, and
    obfuscation.

<!-- -->

-   Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model
    manipulation such as abstract interpretation, static analysis,
    binding-time analysis, dynamic analysis, constraint solving, type
    systems, automated testing and test case generation.

<!-- -->

-   Analysis and transformation for programs/models with advanced
    features such as objects, generics, ownership types, aspects,
    reflection, XML type systems, component frameworks, and middleware.

<!-- -->

-   Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including
    meta-programming, generative programming, deep embedded
    domain-specific languages, program synthesis by sketching and
    inductive programming, staged computation, and model-driven program
    generation and transformation.

<!-- -->

-   Application of the above techniques including experimental studies,
    engineering needed for scalability, and benchmarking. Examples of
    application domains include legacy program understanding and
    transformation, DSL implementations, visual languages and end-user
    programming, scientific computing, middleware frameworks and
    infrastructure needed for distributed and web-based applications,
    resource-limited computation, and security.

We especially encourage papers that break new ground including
descriptions of how program/model manipulation tools can be integrated
into realistic software development processes, descriptions of robust
tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications, and new
areas of application such as rapidly evolving systems, distributed and
web-based programming including middleware manipulation, model-driven
development, and on-the-fly program adaptation driven by run-time or
statistical analysis.

Student attendants with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC
grant to help cover travel expenses. PAC also offers other support, such
as for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for
companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for
travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details
on the PAC program, see the [PAC web
page](http://www.sigplan.org/PAC.htm).

There will be formal proceedings published by ACM Press. In addition to
printed proceedings, accepted papers will be included in the [ACM
Digital Library](http://portal.acm.org/dl.cfm). Selected papers may
later on be invited for a journal special issue dedicated to PEPM\'10.

The [SIGPLAN Republication
Policy](http://www.sigplan.org/republicationpolicy.htm) and [ACM\'s
Policy and Procedures on
Plagiarism](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy)
apply.

Papers should be submitted electronically via the [workshop web
site](PaperSubmission){.twikiLink}.

### []{#Submission_Categories_and_Guidel} Submission Categories and Guidelines

Authors are strongly encouraged to consult the [advice for authoring
research papers](ResearchPaperAdvice){.twikiLink} and [tool
papers](ToolPaperAdvice){.twikiLink} before submitting. The PC Chairs
welcome any inquiries about the authoring advice.

Regular research papers must not exceed 10 pages in ACM Proceedings
style. Tool demonstration papers must not exceed 4 pages in ACM
Proceedings style, and authors will be expected to present a live
demonstration of the described tool at the workshop (tool papers should
include an additional appendix of up to 6 extra pages giving the
outline, screenshots, examples, etc. to indicate the content of the
proposed live demo at the workshop).

Authors using Latex to prepare their submissions should use the [new
improved SIGPLAN proceedings
style](http://www.acm.org/sigs/sigplan/authorInformation.htm)
(sigplanconf.cls, 9pt template).

### []{#Invited_Speakers} Invited Speakers

We are proud to present the following two invited talks:

-   [Lennart Augustsson](http://augustss.blogspot.com/) (Standard
    Chartered Bank, UK): **O, Partial Evaluator, Where Art Thou?**\
    \
    **Abstract:** Partial evaluation is now a quite old idea, and it has
    been implemented many times. Partial evaluation is also very widely
    applicable; almost every problem in computing could use it. But
    widely used partial evaluators are nowhere to be seen. Why is that?
    In this talk I will give some examples of where I have used partial
    evaluation during 15 years of using Haskell commercially. I will
    give my wish list for a partial evaluator I could actually use
    (instead of rewriting it over and over), and also contrast this with
    what is done in the research community.

-   [Jeremy G. Siek](http://ecee.colorado.edu/~siek/) (University of
    Colorado at Boulder, USA): **General Purpose Languages Should be
    Metalanguages.**\
    \
    **Abstract:** In his paper, The Next 700 Programming Languages, the
    late Landin writes that \"most programming languages are partly a
    way of expressing things in terms of other things and partly a basic
    set of given things.\" Landin tries to separate the general purpose
    aspects of a language from the problem specific aspects. Instead of
    hundreds of languages with ad-hoc differences, Landin proposes one
    general-purpose language with many different sets of primitive
    operations for different problem domains. However, achieving this
    separation is not so easy: the domain specific parts cannot always
    be neatly packaged up in a set of primitives, but instead may
    require complex syntactic and semantics structures. In the last
    decade or so we made significant steps towards this vision through
    the development of domain-specific embedded languages (DSELs). We
    discovered how to trick several general purpose languages into
    making software libraries look like domain-specific languages. As a
    result, we now develop DSELs that enjoy many of the benefits of real
    languages: they perform domain-specific type checking, they provide
    custom syntactic abstractions, and they optimize themselves to
    achieve high efficiency. Most importantly, unlike real languages,
    DSELs nicely inter-operate with each other through the underlying
    general purpose language. The main limitation of today\'s DSELs is
    that they leak: the underlying general purpose language peeks
    through at inopportune times. This is not surprising; these general
    purpose languages were not designed to be metalanguages for building
    DSELs. In this talk I argue that general purpose languages should be
    designed to be metalanguages and I identify some features that could
    help our general purpose languages become metalanguages.
