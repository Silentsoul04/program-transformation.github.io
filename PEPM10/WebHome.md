The PEPM Symposium/Workshop series aims to bring together researchers
and practitioners working in the areas of program manipulation, partial
evaluation, and program generation. PEPM focuses on techniques,
theories, tools, and applications of analysis and manipulation of
programs.

The 2010 PEPM workshop will be based on a broad interpretation of
semantics-based program manipulation in a continued effort to expand the
scope of PEPM significantly beyond the traditionally covered areas of
partial evaluation and specialization and include practical applications
of program transformations such as refactoring tools, and practical
implementation techniques such as rule-based transformation systems. In
addition, it covers manipulation and transformations of program and
system representations such as structural and semantic models that occur
in the context of model-driven development. In order to reach out to
practitioners, there is a separate category of tool demonstration
papers.

Topics of interest for PEPM\'10 include, but are not limited to:

-   Program and model manipulation techniques such as transformations
    driven by rules, patterns, or analyses, partial evaluation,
    specialization, program inversion, program composition, slicing,
    symbolic execution, refactoring, aspect weaving, decompilation, and
    obfuscation.

<!-- -->

-   Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model
    manipulation such as abstract interpretation, static analysis,
    binding-time analysis, dynamic analysis, constraint solving, type
    systems, automated testing and test case generation.

<!-- -->

-   Analysis and transformation for programs/models with advanced
    features such as objects, generics, ownership types, aspects,
    reflection, XML type systems, component frameworks, and middleware.

<!-- -->

-   Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including
    meta-programming, generative programming, deep embedded
    domain-specific languages, program synthesis by sketching and
    inductive programming, staged computation, and model-driven program
    generation and transformation.

<!-- -->

-   Application of the above techniques including experimental studies,
    engineering needed for scalability, and benchmarking. Examples of
    application domains include legacy program understanding and
    transformation, DSL implementations, visual languages and end-user
    programming, scientific computing, middleware frameworks and
    infrastructure needed for distributed and web-based applications,
    resource-limited computation, and security.

We especially encourage papers that break new ground including
descriptions of how program/model manipulation tools can be integrated
into realistic software development processes, descriptions of robust
tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications, and new
areas of application such as rapidly evolving systems, distributed and
web-based programming including middleware manipulation, model-driven
development, and on-the-fly program adaptation driven by run-time or
statistical analysis.

Student attendants with accepted papers can apply for a SIGPLAN PAC
grant to help cover travel expenses. PAC also offers other support, such
as for child-care expenses during the meeting or for travel costs for
companions of SIGPLAN members with physical disabilities, as well as for
travel from locations outside of North America and Europe. For details
on the PAC program, see the [PAC web
page](http://www.sigplan.org/PAC.htm).

There will be formal proceedings published by ACM Press. In addition to
printed proceedings, accepted papers will be included in the [ACM
Digital Library](http://portal.acm.org/dl.cfm). Selected papers may
later on be invited for a journal special issue dedicated to PEPM\'10.

Follow this link for the complete [Call for
Papers](CallForPapers){.twikiLink}. There is also a more compact [PDF
version](../pub/PEPM10/WebHome/PEPM10_cfp.pdf).
