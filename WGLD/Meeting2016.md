##### []{#Kim_Bruce_Teaching_with_Grace_Fi} Kim Bruce: Teaching with Grace: First evaluations.

The pedagogical programming language Grace was designed for novices to
programming. This fall was the second time we have used Grace for an
intro course at Pomona College (Andrew Black has also used it with some
slightly different courses at PSU).

In this talk I'll give a quick outline of some of the features of the
Grace design that make it especially helpful in an introductory course.
I'll then talk about the head-to-head comparison we ran this fall with
the Grace version against a Java version of the same course with
parallel texts, assignments, and exams. While we have not yet run a
careful statistical analysis of the detailed results, early indications
are that Grace is a considerable help to novices in learning.

##### []{#Erik_Ernst_Reflection_Quantifica} Erik Ernst: Reflection Quantification

This talk is about the design of a small embedded DSL, intended to
specify the subset of the dynamic semantics of the host language which
is supported by mirror based reflection. The main concepts of the DSL
are capabilities (concerned with the selection of mirror operations) and
annotation (concerned with the selection of host language entities
covered by mirrors). The host is the Dart programming language, and the
context is the Reflectable package. The toughest balancing act in the
design of this DSL was the level of detail: With a detailed level of
control the simple usages may be inconveniently verbose to specify, but
with a coarse-grained level of control, the larger applications may be
forced to have intolerable overhead.

##### []{#Ross_Tate_How_Not_to_Add_Type_Cl} Ross Tate: How Not to Add Type Classes to Type OO Languages

Material-shape separation makes it obvious that typed-OO programmers are
naturally dividing their classes and interfaces into types (materials)
and type classes (shapes). Material-shape separation also ensures that
recursing through types will terminate even when incorporating
inheritance. This suggests an obvious solution to adding type classes to
OO. Unfortunately, the obvious solution doesn\'t work. Although it is
sound and decidable, it clashes with important usage patterns and OO
principles. This is not apparent even after finishing such a design, so
in this talk I will illustrate precisely how this solution is
surprisingly deceptive.

##### []{#Martin_Odersky_Effects_as_Implic} Martin Odersky: Effects as Implicit Capabilities

It seems obvious that one should track the effects of a piece of code
just as one tracks the types of its inputs and outputs. But despite 30
years of research on effect systems, very little of it has been applied
in practice, and what was put in practice is sometimes regarded as a
failure. A central difficulty is how to express \*effect polymorphism\*,
the ability to write a function once, and to have it interact with
arguments that can have arbitrary effects.

I will talk about a new approach to effect checking which has an elegant
solution to the effect polymorphism problem and promises to be quite
usable in practice. The central idea is that instead of talking about
effects we talk about **capabilities**. For instance, instead of saying
a function \`\`throws an IOException\'\' we say that the function
\`\`needs the capability to throw an IOException\'\'. Capabilities are
modeled as values of some set of capability types. I will talk about two
new language features that make this approach attractive.

To cut down on boilerplate, capabilities are passed as implicit
parameters to the functions that need them. Implicit parameters make
call-site annotations unnecessary, but they still have to be declared
just like normal parameters. The new construct of implicit function
types makes parameters abstractable and thus eliminates declaration-side
boilerplate.

Second, there is one fundamental difference between the usual notions of
capabilities and effects: Capabilities can be captured in closures. This
means that a capability present at closure construction time can be
preserved and accessed when the closure is applied. Effects on the other
hand, are temporal: it generally does make a difference whether an
effect occurs when a closure is constructed or when it is used. We
propose to address this discrepancy by introducing a \`\`pure
function\'\' type, instances of which are not allowed to close over
effect capabilities.

#### []{#Jens_Palsberg_Breaking_Through_t} Jens Palsberg: Breaking Through the Normalization Barrier: A Self-Interpreter for F-omega

According to conventional wisdom, a self-interpreter for a strongly
normalizing lambda-calculus is impossible. We call this the
normalization barrier. The normalization barrier stems from a theorem in
computability theory that says that a total universal function for the
total computable functions is impossible. I will show how to break
through the normalization barrier and define a self-interpreter for a
widely used strongly normalizing lambda-calculus. After a careful
analysis of the classical theorem, we show that static type checking can
exclude the proof\'s diagonalization gadget and leave open the
possibility for a self-interpreter. Our self-interpreter relies on a
novel program representation that may be useful in theorem provers and
compilers. Joint work with Matt Brown; presented at POPL 2016.

##### []{#Manuel_Serrano_Hop_js} Manuel Serrano: Hop.js

Hop.js is a multitier extension of
[JavaScript[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/JavaScript?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2016)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"}. It allows a single
[JavaScript[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/JavaScript?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2016)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"} program to describe the client-side and
the server-side components of a Web application. Its runtime environment
ensures a consistent execution of the application on the server and on
the client. This talk will shows its minimal set of
[JavaScript[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/JavaScript?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2016)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"} extensions that makes Web programming
easier. It will present its runtime environment, with an emphasize on
the handling of server-side parallelism.

##### []{#Crista_Lopes_Yet_another_SQL_OO}[]{#Crista_Lopes_Yet_another_SQL_OO_} Crista Lopes: Yet another SQL-OO integration (YASOO) with dependent types and differential computation (YASOO-DT)

I\'ve been working in large-scale, decentralized simulations of urban
areas \[1\], and a problem has come up repeatedly: how to partition the
load and how to share data between the partitions. In these kinds of
systems, if you are not careful you end up with APIs that don\'t align
well with stakeholders and expert developers and that, therefore, are
very painful to develop for. In trying to improve the development
process of these simulations, I am converging to a solution that has
roots in relational algebra, dependent types and differential
computation. It works in the lab! \[2\]

in the wild is still TBD

##### []{#Sean_McDirmid_The_past_present_a} Sean [McDirmid[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/McDirmid?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2016)]{.twikiNewLink style="background : #FFFFCE;"}: The past, present, and future of live programming

This talk will present the promise of live programming as I currently
see it. Narrowly defined, live programming has been about providing
feedback about how a program executes while it is being written by the
programmer, combining the phases of debugging and editing for a more
fluid feedback loop. However, as Chris Hancock and Bret Victor have
pointed out, this really isn't good enough to move the needle on better
programmer experiences. Through multiple demos, I will show what works
and what hasn't worked, and more importantly provide context on why
these results occurred. I will then present some future directions for
this field.

##### []{#Andrew_Black_The_Essence_of_Inhe} Andrew Black: The Essence of Inheritance

Programming languages serve a dual purpose: to communicate programs to
computers, and to communicate programs to humans. Indeed, it is this
dual purpose that makes programming language design a constrained and
challenging problem. Inheritance is an essential aspect of that second
purpose: it is a tool to improve communication. Humans understand new
concepts most readily by first looking at a number of concrete examples,
and later abstracting over those examples. The essence of inheritance is
that it mirrors this process: it provides a formal mechanism for moving
from the concrete to the abstract.

##### []{#Todd_Millstein_Why_Do_Language_D} Todd Millstein: Why Do Language Designers Tolerate Weak Memory Consistency Models?

Almost all languages today are memory safe, thereby providing simple and
strong guarantees to all programs, buggy or otherwise. Yet the
concurrency semantics of these "safe" languages causes similar problems
as arise in memory-unsafe languages: small program errors can expose
implementation details, violate fundamental language abstractions, and
compromise program safety. Why do language designers tolerate this
situation? In this talk I'll overview the state of concurrency semantics
as it exists today and argue that safe languages must support sequential
consistency (i.e., the interleaving semantics of threads). Along the way
I'll also debunk a few persistent myths.

##### []{#Michael_Greenberg_The_POSIX_shel} Michael Greenberg: The POSIX shell as a programming language

We build intricate systems with complex algorithms and invariants,
aiming for guarantees of correctness and performance\... and then we
maintain and deploy these systems with shell scripts! What **are** shell
scripts? If POSIX shell is a programming language, what are its syntax
and semantics? Can we apply PL tools to reason about the shell?

##### []{#Adam_Chlipala_A_Micro_Tutorial_o} Adam Chlipala: A Micro-Tutorial on Multi-Tier Metaprogramming with Ur/Web

One of the unusual features of the Ur/Web programming language is
flexible but statically typed generation of web-application code that
needs to coordinate across three different tiers: database, web server,
and browser. I will demonstrate the main ideas with a simple generic
component for adding rows to an SQL database table.

##### []{#Jonathan_Edwards_Transcript_not}[]{#Jonathan_Edwards_Transcript_not_} Jonathan Edwards: Transcript: not programming mobile social apps

Transcript is an experiment to radically simplify programming of mobile
social applications. We will demonstrate an early prototype and discuss
the key design ideas that simplify the programming experience.

##### []{#Jonathan_Aldrich_Achieving_Archi} Jonathan Aldrich: Achieving Architectural Control via Language Support for Capabilities

Many important architectural properties of software depend on how
resources such as storage or the network are used. Unfortunately,
today\'s software architects have few ways to control those resources,
other than by leveraging woefully inadequate software processes. We
propose to leverage capabilities\--unforgeable tokens that control
access to resources\--to isolate the enforcement of architectural
properties to a few critical resource-using modules, on which assurance
efforts can be focused. We also present improvements in language support
for capabilities, including a non-transitive model of capability-based
authority, a capability-aware module system, and design principles for
type systems and reflection systems that are compatible with
capabilities.

##### []{#Alessandro_Warth_Growing_Languag} Alessandro Warth: Growing Language Designers

Despite the high caliber of our students, the recurring Programming
Language Design Seminar at UCLA did not consistently generate the kind
of output we had hoped for. One issue was that students lacked the PL
prototyping chops required to do meaningful work in such a short time
--- 10 weeks fly by when you're having fun. Last year we created a new
class to address this problem. Thanks in part to a novel framework that
aims to minimize unnecessary friction and give students "instant
gratification" when possible, the new class was a great success and
turned out to be much more popular than we anticipated. (Joint work with
Todd Millstein and Alan Kay.)

#### []{#Eelco_Visser_The_Name_Binding_Ga} Eelco Visser: The Name Binding Game

In this talk I explore the expressiveness (or lack thereof) of the scope
graph framework for encoding the name binding rules of programming
languages.

#### []{#Evan_Czaplicki_Type_inference_an} Evan Czaplicki: Type inference and excellent error messages

The last two release of Elm (0.15.1 and 0.16) focused primarily on
producing excellent error messages. The conventional wisdom seemed to be
\"making nice error messages in type inferred languages is not really
feasible, so just get used to how things are.\" This is not a recipe for
growing a successful language in the JS world though. As I began
exploring this topic I found that you can make enormous practical
improvements for your users without anything particularly fancy. I
believe the general technique I used in Elm would work just as well in
languages with more complex type systems (like OCaml or Haskell) as long
as they use a constraint-based solver.

#### []{#Heather_Miller_Distributed_progr} Heather Miller: Distributed programming via safe closure passing

Scala is a popular implementation language of big data frameworks.
Leading frameworks like Spark and Kafka have nodded their hats to Scala,
noting that some of their ability to innovate were provided by aspects
of Scala's mixed object-functional design, such as its support for
first-class functions. However, problems abound; function closures in
Scala weren't designed with the idea of them being serialized and sent
over the wire in mind, resulting in end-user headaches across
frameworks. We proposed a solution to the closure serialization problem
with spores, a refinement to functions in Scala that make closures more
reliable to serialize. I\'ll discuss ongoing work on a programming model
we have built atop of spores which aims to generalize models like
[MapReduce[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/MapReduce?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2016)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"} by enabling a more principled way to move
\"functionality\" to immutable data spread across a network.
