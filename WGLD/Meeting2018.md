[]{#Slides} Slides
------------------

The slides of many of the talks are now available in the table at the
bottom of this page.

[]{#Program} Program
--------------------

The meeting starts on Monday morning May 14th at 9AM and ends with lunch
on Friday May 18th.

The program consists of a series of 50 minute sessions, which are
scheduled during the meeting. In each session the speaker gets 25
minutes to present and the audience gets 25 minutes to discuss, in no
particular order (although we tend to give the presenter a couple of
minutes to at least introduce the topic). Time is administered using a
chess clock. (If attendance is high we may have to reduce session times
somewhat.)

Prospective speakers are invited to send a talk proposal including title
and abstract to the chair ([Eelco Visser](mailto:e.visser@tudelft.nl)).

[]{#Venue} Venue
----------------

The meeting will take place in Antwerp, Belgium in the offices of [Nokia
Bell
Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/connect/global-locations/Antwerp-belgium/).

The offices are conveniently located right next to Antwerp Central
railway station and a 10-minute walk from the city centre.

Address: Nokia Bell, Copernicuslaan 50, 2018 Antwerp, Belgium
([Map](https://www.google.be/maps/place/Nokia/@51.2139508,4.4217501,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c3f704608118e7:0xc1c6c42e6eaf595b!8m2!3d51.2139508!4d4.4239441)).
(please note: main entrance is on the Kievitplein, a pedestrian-only
square, not in Copernicuslaan. The entrance is clearly marked with a big
NOKIA sign.)

On the first day, please register at Reception through the main entrance
(mention WGLD meeting with Tom Van Cutsem) and wait until someone comes
to fetch you.

We will be meeting in Nokia building C, 11th floor, room C11-Tim
Berners-Lee.

[]{#Getting_There} Getting There
--------------------------------

Fly into either Brussels National Airport (BRU) or Amsterdam Schiphol
Airport (AMS). Brussels is closer to the final destination, but
Amsterdam has more direct long-haul flights.

From Brussels airport, the easiest option is to simply take a local
train from the Brussels airport train station to Antwerp Central
station. There\'s a direct connection that should get you from the
airport into Antwerp in about 30 minutes (no upfront seat reservation
required). The meeting venue is located right next to Antwerp\'s Central
station.

From Amsterdam Schiphol airport, there is also a direct train service to
Antwerp. You can either take a local commuter train (no upfront seat
reservation required) which should get you there in about 2 hours, or
take a high-speed train (Thalys) which will get you there in 56 minutes.
Thalys trains require upfront seat
[reservation](https://www.b-europe.com/EN).

For train time tables and tickets, see the website of the Belgian
national railway service
[NMBS](http://www.belgianrail.be/en/Default.aspx).

Detailed instructions for getting to the Nokia Bell Labs Antwerp
offices, including some sightseeing highlights, can be found [in this
leaflet](http://program-transformation.org/pub/WGLD/Meeting2018/Directions_to_Nokia_Bell_Labs_Antwerp.pdf).

### []{#Markus_Voelter_A_spreadsheet_ext} Markus Voelter: A spreadsheet extension for KernelF

As we all (sometimes slightly jealously) acknowledge, spreadsheets are
used widely for \"programming\", especially by the domain-experts we
often want to convince of DSLs. We also all agree about the limitations
of spreadsheets in terms the error-proneness of large, intricate sheets.

Essentially, spreadsheets represent functional programs that are
executed reactively, whenever a user changes the contents of a cell.
This makes them fit well with functional programming in general.

In this talk I present a prototypical extension of the
[KernelF[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/KernelF?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2018)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"} functional programming language that
supports spreadsheets. I briefly introduce
[KernelF[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/KernelF?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2018)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"}, discuss the motivation for building the
spreadsheet extension and then demonstrate how it fits in with
[KernelF[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/KernelF?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2018)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"}\'s functional paradigm.

We have also made several extensions of the spreadsheet paradigm that
aim at fixing some of the problems observed in spreadsheets. I will
introduce those, and hope to get feedback on other ideas we could

### []{#Eelco_Visser_The_Syntax_Definiti} Eelco Visser: The Syntax Definition Formalism SDF3

I describe the design of the syntax definition formalism SDF3 by means
of propositions that capture its concepts.

### []{#Andrew_P_Black_Design_Principles} Andrew P. Black: Design Principles for  the Grace AST

Grace dialects can restrict the dialectic language by writing a
tree-walker for the AST that restricts allowable programs (compared to
standard Grace). As a consequence, the Grace language definition must
include a definition of an AST for Grace.

What are the requirements on such an AST? Can we come up with "Design
Principles" for an AST to guide us in its design? How do we know when
the AST is adequate? Or when it is overspecified? What is an AST,
anyway?

Now that there are multiple implementations of Grace, it is time to face
these questions. I don't have many answers, but hope that the combined
expertise of the working group will help us find some.

### []{#Roberto_Ierusalimschy_The_Titan}[]{#Roberto_Ierusalimschy_The_Titan_} Roberto Ierusalimschy: The Titan Programming Language

The Titan Programming Language: a statically typed companion language to
Lua, designed for writing applications and libraries, with performance
in mind.

### []{#Jonathan_Edwards_Direct_Programm} Jonathan Edwards: Direct Programming

To make programming more concrete I am taking another run at the old
ideas of macro recording and Programming by Example. Many such efforts
abstracted user actions into conventional code. Instead I co-design the
PL and UI to be analogous, so that programs and users have the same
capabilities, and programs look much like recorded transcripts of user
actions. This correspondence may aid beginning programmers. Another
benefit is that programs can not only be abstracted from user actions
but also be incrementally revised through further actions.

Any attempt to make programming more concrete must overcome two main
obstacles: loops and conditionals, for they deal with hypothetical
situations. My approach is to extend the direct manipulation metaphor
onto *template* states that prototype iteration, and *example* states
that witness alternative cases.

### []{#Jan_Vitek_The_Beauty_and_the_Bea} Jan Vitek: The Beauty and the Beast --- from Fortress to Julia

Take two languages, Julia and Fortress, designed to solve similar
problems with similar mechanisms and compare the approaches that led to
one to being adopted and the other discontinued. What lessons are there
for language designers? Can the designs be reconciled? Can we somehow
turn the beast that is into the beauty that could have been? This talk
is a snapshot of our investigations into Julia with more open questions
than definitive answers. Julia' design is a pragmatic effort driven by
use-cases and user feedback. In contrast, Fortress followed a
principled, formally grounded, approach that aimed for type soundness
first. We will marvel at the efficacy of Julia\'s compiler \-- a
one-trick pony that works well in practice. We will inspect the
multi-dispatch feature of Julia and puzzle at the subtype relation that
is at its heart. The takeaway of the talk is a list of language features
that are key to performance and usability.

### []{#Ronald_Garcia_Type_driven_Gradua} Ronald Garcia: Type-driven Gradual Security Typing

Information-flow security-typed programming languages use types to
statically enforce noninterference between potentially conspiring
values, such as the arguments and results of functions. But to adopt
static security types, like other advanced type disciplines, programmers
must adopt the discipline wholesale.

To provide a gentler path to security typing, researchers have designed
languages that blend static and dynamic checking of security types.
Unfortunately most of these languages support static, type-based
reasoning about noninterference if programs are entirely statically
secured. This limitation substantially weakens the benefits that dynamic
enforcement brings to static security typing.

This talk describes GSLref, a security-typed higher-order language that
supports gradual migration between a simple type discipline and security
type discipline, using the principles underlying gradual typing.

GSLref satisfies most of the criteria set forth by Siek et al. for
gradually-typed languages. The one exception, called the \"dynamic
gradual guarantee\" cannot be satisfied without violating
noninterference.

To realize this design, we were led to draw a sharp distinction between
syntactic type safety and semantic type soundness, each of which
constrains the design of the gradual language.

### []{#Stefan_Marr_Designing_Small_and}[]{#Stefan_Marr_Designing_Small_and_} Stefan Marr: Designing Small and Versatile Collection Libraries: Providing an Efficient and Thread-Safe Implementation

Collection libraries differ significantly between languages, but there
are some indications that we could make do for most use cases simply
with sequence, map, and set collections. Modern dynamic languages show
this form of minimalism and compensate by making their collections
highly versatile. For instance, an array is usually dynamically sized
and provides operations to act as queue, dequeue, or stack. However,
this design comes with implementation challenges and dynamic language
implementations apply various optimizations to make it efficient.

So far, these optimizations have been one of the reasons that languages
such as Ruby and Python do not yet have implementations that are
efficient and allow parallel execution while providing a thread-safe
implementation that does not expose any races from the VM implementation
to the language.

This talk presents a technique to ensure implementation-level
thread-safety for such collections. With it, we enable an idiomatic
dynamic language programming style for parallel code. In practice this
means, VMs do not need a global interpreter lock to guarantee safety
while avoiding to compromise single-threaded execution performance.

### []{#Matthias_Hauswirth_Misconception} Matthias Hauswirth: Misconceptions & PL Design

Programming languages are conceptually dense constructions. Expressing a
program in a given language requires an accurate understanding of the
concepts of that language. A programmer's misconceptions about a
language eventually lead to incorrect programs.

In this talk I will give a brief introduction to an area of the learning
sciences focusing on human conceptions, misconceptions, and conceptual
change. I will then try to connect these ideas to programming language
design. My goal with this talk is to trigger discussions on PL design
and evaluation by stepping outside the normal PL design zone.

### []{#Klaus_Ostermann_Dualizing_Genera} Klaus Ostermann: Dualizing Generalized Algebraic Data Types by Matrix Transposition

We characterize the relation between generalized algebraic datatypes
(GADTs) with pattern matching on their constructors one hand, and
generalized algebraic co-datatypes
([GAcoDTs[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/GAcoDTs?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2018)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"}) with copattern matching on their
destructors on the other hand: GADTs can be converted mechanically to
[GAcoDTs[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/GAcoDTs?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2018)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"} by refunctionalization,
[GAcoDTs[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/GAcoDTs?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2018)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"} can be converted mechanically to GADTs by
defunctionalization, and both defunctionalization and
refunctionalization correspond to a transposition of the matrix in which
the equations for each constructor/destructor pair of the (co-)datatype
are organized. We have defined a calculus, GADT\^T, which unifies GADTs
and
[GAcoDTs[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/GAcoDTs?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2018)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"} in such a way that GADTs and
[GAcoDTs[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/GAcoDTs?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2018)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"} are merely different ways to partition
the program.

We have formalized the type system and operational semantics of GADT\^T
in the Coq proof assistant and have mechanically verified the following
results: 1) The type system of \\ourlang{} is sound, 2)
defunctionalization and refunctionalization can translate GADTs to
[GAcoDTs[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/GAcoDTs?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2018)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"} and back, 3) both transformations are
type- and semantics-preserving and are inverses of each other, 4)
(co-)datatypes can be represented by matrices in such a way the
aforementioned transformations correspond to matrix transposition, 5)
GADTs are extensible in an exactly dual way to
[GAcoDTs[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/GAcoDTs?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2018)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"}; we thereby clarify folklore knowledge
about the \`\`expression problem\'\'.

We believe that the identification of this relationship can guide future
language design of \`\`dual features\'\' for data and codata.

This talk is based on joint work with Julian Jabs.

### []{#Eric_Tanter_Gradual_Parametricit} Eric Tanter: Gradual Parametricity, Revisited

Bringing the benefits of gradual typing to a language with parametric
polymorphism like System F, while preserving relational parametricity,
has proven extremely challenging: first attempts were formulated almost
a decade ago, and several recent developments have been published in the
past year. On the one hand, the different forces at play have led
researchers to propose language designs with varying goals and
compromises, with sometimes surprising consequences. On the other hand,
the complexity of the technical details has resulted in several
important results to remain stated as conjectures. In this work, we
first identify a crucial, yet ignored, property of a language with
gradual parametricity, which turns out to be violated by all prior work.
This observation suggests that existing cast calculi are not well suited
for supporting a gradual version of System F. We then formulate clear
design goals for a gradual language with explicit parametric
polymorphism, GSF, and explore to which extent the Abstracting Gradual
Typing methodology helps us derive such a language. GSF satisfies all
the expected properties, save for one property---the dynamic gradual
guarantee---which was left as conjecture in all prior work. Here, we
prove that this property is simply incompatible with parametricity,
unless one is willing to adjust accepted definitions. This situation,
reminiscent of recent results on gradual noninterference, reinforces the
view that new criteria might be needed to characterize the spectrum of
type-based reasoning that gradual typing supports when applied to
semantically-rich disciplines.

### []{#William_Cook_Rethinking_Excel_in} William Cook: Rethinking Excel in Enso

I'm trying to rethink Excel to eliminate repeated but slightly different
equations, and have a secure approach to editing rows and columns, so
that equations are always correctly defined. I have two sample Excel
applications: one involving grades (normalizing them, curving them,
combining them, etc), and one involving work scheduling, but the idea
changing Excel to have a Data Model, Computation Model, and a
Presentation model, is generally appealing. The question is how to
design the modeling languages to work together and implement an engine
that can let users view the models as a grid (or other views), while
editing at multiple different levels. I need some help with my
presentation model.

### []{#Luke_Church_Entangling_intellige} Luke Church: Entangling intelligences

I present work at Lark Systems, integrating together different types of
thinking and the way these affect the way people program.

### []{#Francois_Pottier} Francois Pottier

Reachability and error diagnosis in LR(1) parsers

Contrary to an ill-advised folklore myth, an LR(1) parser **can**
produce good syntax error messages. In fact, an LR(1) parser generator
can build a collection of erroneous input sentences that covers every
"error state", that is, every state of the LR automaton in which an
error might be detected. This feature can be exploited by a grammar
designer to examine each such state and either (a) propose a handwritten
diagnostic message for this state, or (b) modify the grammar and/or the
automaton so that this error state disappears. I report on an
application of this technique to the
[CompCert[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/CompCert?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2018)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"} ISO C99 parser, and discuss its strengths
and limitations. (This work was presented at CC 2016.)

and the visitors talk:

Visitors Unchained

Traversing and transforming abstract syntax trees that involve name
binding is notoriously difficult to do in a correct, concise, modular,
customizable manner. I address this problem in the setting of OCaml, a
functional programming language equipped with powerful object-oriented
features, using visitor classes as partial, composable descriptions of
the operations that we wish to perform on abstract syntax trees. (This
work was presented at ICFP 2017.)

### []{#Sylvan_Clebsch_Language_Runtimes} Sylvan Clebsch: Language Runtimes for Parallel Programming: Weak Memory and Program Order

Language runtimes notoriously involve frantic bit twiddling, very fine
grained atomic operations, and a reliance on the specific behaviour of
particular architectural targets. How do we know our code implements our
intended memory model? How do we know our memory model maps, and maps
efficiently, to the hardware memory model? What is "program order" when
we need interleaved and independent "happens before" guarantees? What is
the type of a range of memory reserved by the memory allocator before it
has been committed, or after it has been freed by the language? Perhaps
we need a low-level systems language for writing runtimes that treats
"happens before" as a core building block.

### []{#Jan_Willem_Maessen_Confessions_o} Jan-Willem Maessen: Confessions of a Reluctant Imperative Programmer

I consider myself a functional programmer who happens to do a lot of
systems programming in non-functional languages. But the imperative
style of control flow -- loops with break and continue, functions with
intermediate return, local variables that can be re-bound -- is in many
cases easier for me as a programmer to read and write than the
equivalent code in a typical functional language. Why is this? And when
does it break down? I\'ll end with some questions about how we might do
better.
