-   Dates: August 28 - September 1, 2017
-   Venue: Park City, Utah, USA
-   Host: [Matthew Flatt](mailto:mflatt@cs.utah.edu)

[]{#Venue} Venue
----------------

The meeting will take place at the [Treasure Mountain
Inn](https://treasuremountaininn.com/) in Park City, Utah. Park City is
best known as a ski destination and as the home of the [Sundance Film
Festival](https://www.sundance.org/festivals/sundance-film-festival).
Tourists also visit in the summer, but late August will be uncrowded.

See [Accommodations](Meeting2017#accommodations) below for information
on booking a room at the group rate in the meeting hotel.

[]{#Getting_There} Getting There
--------------------------------

Fly to Salt Lake International Airport (SLC). Park City is about 40
minutes from the airport by car or shuttle. [All
Resort](http://www.allresort.com/van.aspx) is a popular shuttle service,
or see
[visitparkcity.com](https://www.visitparkcity.com/plan-your-trip/transportation/).
The hotel recommends [Express for Less](https://www.xpress4lessut.com/)
(435-649-8999).

A shuttle typically costs \$40 one way. A taxi or private car will
easily be twice that. Renting a car from the airport is convenient and
likely to be cheaper if 2 or more people carpool. The hotel provides
parking, and you won\'t need a car in Park City itself, since the hotel
is right on Main Street and surrounded by restaurants, shops, and
mountains, but you can get to even better outdoor activities with a
short drive into the mountains.

[]{#Coordination_and_Registration} Coordination and Registration
----------------------------------------------------------------

Please **[fill out this
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8USGH6rs5A_MZG5dZ16_Y4ta6N-NmXT39kUKkyRE6q-m8xQ/viewform)**
to let the organizers know that you will attend and to get help
coordinating transportation and/or accommodations.

The registration fee will cover the meeting room, coffee/tea during the
meeting, all lunches, and all dinners. The fee will be collected at the
end of the meeting based on actual costs, expected to be \$325 per
person.

[]{#Accommodations} Accommodations
----------------------------------

[]{#accommodations}Contract [Treasure Mountain
Inn](https://www.treasuremountaininn.com/) through the web site or by
phone to make a reservation.

We originally had a group rate of \$126/night single occupancy,
\$146/night double occupancy, but the hotel is now under new management,
and the normal advertised rates have been cheaper than that.

Note that the room options include a two-bedroom suite, so consider
rooming with another participant to reduce costs.

[]{#Schedule} Schedule
----------------------

The meeting will start at 8:45am on Monday, August 28 and continue
through lunchtime on Friday, September 1. We plan a hiking excursion
into the surrounding mountains on Wednesday after lunch.

#### []{#Jonathan_Edwards_Reifying_Progra} Jonathan Edwards: Reifying Programming

The need to think abstractly makes programming difficult, especially for
normal people. To make programming more concrete I propose to represent
programs as data structures reifying their execution. Programming shifts
from editing textual abstractions to direct inspection and manipulation
of concrete executions. Reified execution also helps ground abstraction
through a new testing mechanism: interventions. An intervention tests
and overrides behavior at a specific point within a reified execution,
replacing hand-coded tests and mocks. Intervention points are stable
because programs are edited structurally, not textually. Interventions
also provide scaffolding that assists program development through
refactoring-like steps of gradual abstraction.

#### []{#Matthias_Hauswirth_Abstraction_F} Matthias Hauswirth: Abstraction-Free Programming

Abstraction is probably the most important idea in programming. However,
many people have difficulties with abstract thinking. If we want to
teach programming to all, could we do so without requiring abstract
thinking? In this this talk we discuss this question and propose three
abstraction-free programming \"languages\" that might help to provide an
initial programming experience for people without abstraction skills. We
hope to get feedback on our three language ideas and spark a discussion
about abstraction and programming in general.

#### []{#Michael_Greenberg_Kleene_algebra} Michael Greenberg: Kleene algebra modulo theories

Are you working on something that can be modeled in terms of simple
While programs over some decidable domain? Kleene algebra modulo
theories (KMT) is a pay-as-you-go approach for sound, complete, and
decidable models of simple programs. The KMT metatheory corresponds
directly to an automata-theoretic implementation strategy: for just a
few lines of code describing your theory's syntax and decision
procedure, we can decide equivalences in While programs over your
theory.

#### []{#Yannis_Smaragdakis_Languages_for} Yannis Smaragdakis: Languages for Large Productivity Gains: What Will they Look Like?

In the past decade, I\'ve worked a lot with (and on) declarative
languages. I\'ll use this experience as a basis to discuss what a
high-productivity language of the future (or the present!) might look
like. This is a continuation of my Lausanne meeting talk, with more
emphasis on the lessons learned. I will argue that a high-productivity
language a) will have implementations capable of large performance gains
(i.e., the difference between optimized and unoptimized performance will
be asymptotically large); b) will need strict limits (such as
termination or logical monotonicity) to preserve a reasonable
programming model; c) will change development patterns often taken for
granted.

#### []{#Tom_van_Cutsem_Machine_learning}[]{#Tom_van_Cutsem_Machine_learning_} Tom van Cutsem: Machine learning and software development: what does the future hold?

I would love to allocate some time for a discussion about how recent
advances in machine learning and AI will (or will not) affect
programming languages and software development in general. I can prepare
a 10-minute introduction to the topic, highlighting a few interesting
ideas I\'ve seen recently where people have started to apply AI
techniques to software development and programming. For example,
Microsoft research recently published a paper where they\'ve trained a
neural network to learn to write code. After the intro, I can then act
as a moderator for the rest of the discussion. The idea is to discuss
long-term trends, not technical details of specific ideas.

#### []{#Tom_van_Cutsem_XStream_declarati} Tom van Cutsem: XStream: declarative authoring of distributed, elastic stream processing pipelines

In this talk I will present XStream, a DSL for writing stream processing
queries that are to be executed across distributed network nodes.
XStream is used in a stream processing system developed at Nokia Bell
Labs to do real-time processing of data and media streams. I will
briefly discuss the DSL and how queries get compiled. XStream started
off as an external DSL but was later revised to become an embedded DSL.
I will recount some lessons learned which are pertinent to language
design in an industrial research context in general.

#### []{#Kim_Bruce_Exploring_the_inherita} Kim Bruce: Exploring the inheritance design space with Grace

Inheritance and delegation are the two most popular ways of modifying
classes and objects to create new objects. Delegation is often used with
object-based languages, while inheritance is generally the choice with
class-based languages. However while investigating how to include
inheritance in Grace, we discovered that there are many subtle
differences in defining these notions, and many subtleties that can
reach out to bite you. In this talk we explore the design space, and
discuss how we chose to support inheritance in Grace.

#### []{#Emerson_Murphy_Hill_What_Do_Blin} Emerson Murphy-Hill: What Do Blind Developers Need in a Programming Language?

People who are blind use mainstream programming languages and
environments to develop software, but a variety of usability challenges
impact them disproportionately and require awkward workarounds. In this
talk, I\'ll discuss what those challenges are, describe some preliminary
design criteria for a programming language that overcomes those
challenges, and ask for audience suggestions about how we can make
progress on this problem.

#### []{#Daan_Leijen_Structured_Asynchron} Daan Leijen: Structured Asynchrony with Algebraic Effects

Algebraic effect handlers generalize many control-flow abstractions that
are implemented specially in most languages, like exception handling,
iterators, or backtracking. In this article, we show how we can
implement full support for asynchronous programming as a library using
just algebraic effect handlers. The consistent type driven approach also
leads naturally to powerful abstractions like block-scoped interleaving,
cancellation, and timeout's that are lacking in other major asynchronous
frameworks. We also introduce the concept of ambient state to reason
about state that is local to the current strand of asynchronous
execution

#### []{#Manuel_Serrano_Optimistic_JavaSc} Manuel Serrano: Optimistic [JavaScript[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/JavaScript?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2017)]{.twikiNewLink style="background : #FFFFCE;"} AOT Compilation

[JavaScript[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/JavaScript?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2017)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"} has escaped web pages. It is now also
used for programming web servers, compilers, and other general purpose
tasks. There is even a growing trend for using it for programming
embedded devices. In this context, JIT compilation is ineffective
because it is too memory demanding, and interpretation is too slow for
anything else but simplistic tasks. Static compilation, //a.k.a.//,
ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, is an alternative approach that can
combine the good speed of JIT compilers and the lightweight memory
footprint of interpreters.

We have designed an AOT compiler for full-fledged
[JavaScript[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/JavaScript?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2017)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"}. It relies on a genuine type analysis
called //hint typing//. Contrary to most approaches, hint typing does
not infer types according to the data structures the program manipulates
but according to the best code the compiler is able to generate. In this
presentation, we will present this analysis and the overall architecture
of the compiler.

#### []{#Adam_Chlipala_Correct_by_Constru} Adam Chlipala: Correct-by-Construction Code Generation for Elliptic-Curve Cryptography

Cryptography libraries make up some of the most important
high-performance code. Every SSL-based Web connection involves a suite
of algorithms carefully designed for performance. These crucial
functions are even commonly handcoded in assembly by the experts \-- of
which there are only a handful on the planet with the required skills.
Many cryptographic algorithms manipulate large integers with modular
arithmetic. A change so seemingly trivial as picking a different large
prime modulus for an existing algorithm leads, in practice, to one of
these experts spending months rewriting and retesting the assembly code
from scratch.

I will present our Fiat Cryptography project, which generates new
implementations automatically, specifically for the domain of
elliptic-curve cryptography. Even better, our framework is a Coq
library, and we generate correctness proofs, too. The results are
performance-competitive, coming within about 3X (and shrinking, as we
add optimizations) of the latency of world-champion implementations
written by hand. We use a combination of traditional verification,
partial evaluation, and certified compilation. At the center of the
framework is a library for big-integer arithmetic, parametrized by a
vocabulary of available data structures. Different prime moduli get the
best performance with different data structures, and we prove
correctness of the core arithmetic operations for all data structures in
our parameter space.

This is joint work with Andres Erbsen, Jason Gross, Jade Philipoom, and
Robert Sloan.

#### []{#Nada_Amin_Collapsing_Towers_of_I} Nada Amin: Collapsing Towers of Interpreters

Abstract: Given a tower of interpreters, i.e. a sequence of interpreters
interpreting each other, we aim to collapse this tower into a one-pass
compiler that removes all interpretive overhead. We present a
multi-level lambda calculus that features staging constructs and stage
polymorphism: based on runtime parameters, the interpreter can either
act as a normal interpreter or generate code, which turns it into a
compiler, according to the Futamura projections. We identify stage
polymorphism as the key mechanism to make such interpreters compose in a
collapsible way.

We present a meta-circular Lisp interpreter on top of this calculus and
demonstrate that we can collapse arbitrarily many levels of
self-interpretation, including levels with semantic modifications. We
discuss several examples: compiling regular expressions through a Lisp
interpreter to base code, building program transformers from modified
interpreters, and others. We develop these ideas further into an
implementation of the reflective language Black, which implements a
conceptually infinite tower, where every aspect of the semantics can
change dynamically, and as a novel feature, we demonstrate how user
programs can be compiled and recompiled under user-modified semantics

#### []{#ric_Tanter_Designing_Gradual_Lan}[]{#_ric_Tanter_Designing_Gradual_La} Ã‰ric Tanter: Designing Gradual Languages

Gradualizing type systems often involves a lot of guesswork. Based on an
understanding of gradual types as abstractions of static types, we have
developed systematic foundations for gradual typing based on abstract
interpretation. This talk reports on recent work in applying this
approach to a number of typing disciplines. In particular, we highlight
the value of Galois connections in gradual language design, and identify
open research questions.

#### []{#Eelco_Visser_The_Semantics_of_Na} Eelco Visser: The Semantics of Name Resolution in Grace

Grace is a dynamic object oriented programming language designed to aid
programming education. We present a for- mal model of and give an
operational semantics for its object model and name resolution
algorithm. Our main contribu- tions are a systematic model of Grace's
name resolution using scope graphs, relating linguistic features to
other languages, and an operationalization of this model in the form of
an operational semantics which is readable and executable. The semantics
are extensively tested against a reference Grace implementation.

This is joint work with Vlad Vergu and Michiel Haisma

#### []{#Luke_Church_A_metaphysical_turn}[]{#Luke_Church_A_metaphysical_turn_} Luke Church: A metaphysical turn for designing programming experiences?

There are a variety of techniques for analysing the design of
programming experiences; how these techniques relate to each other has
become a contentious issue. To help illuminate the problem we report the
findings of in depth interviews with 20+ staff involved in the evolution
of Dart, how they reason about changes to the language and what they
would like to know.

From this pragmatic grounding, we introduce the notion of \'analytical
distance\' as a way of talking about the various techniques available.
This highlights a major gap between what designers what to know and what
our existing techniques can tell them. We speculate that adopting a
metaphysical stance on programming language usability might help address
this gap.

#### []{#Eric_Eide_A_DSL_for_Secure_Cloud} Eric Eide: A DSL for Secure Cloud-based Collaboration

Despite advances in cloud security, cloud tenants remain vulnerable to
network-based attacks. IP networks allow devices to communicate by
default, and restrictions imposed by firewalls tend to be
coarse-grained, largely static, and centrally administered. What if the
network instead followed the principle of least privilege and allowed
tenants to dynamically craft just the communication policies they need?
In this talk I will describe a DSL that aims to strengthen the network
security of cloud tenants and multi-tenant collaborations. A variant of
this DSL has been implemented in a system called
[CapNet[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/CapNet?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2017)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"}, but it remains a work in progress. For
example, the DSL does not yet address DPI,
[QoS[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/QoS?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2017)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"}, or routing concerns. It also does not
yet account for collaborations between tenants in separately
administered clouds. These and other extensions of the DSL are
unresolved language-design challenges.

#### []{#Matthew_Flatt_Designing_a_Langua} Matthew Flatt: Designing a Language for Cognitive-Science Experiments

In a typical experiment to test a cognitive-science hypothesis, a human
subject receives a sequence of stimuli, where each stimulus\'s
properties are determined by a number of experimenter-selected factors
(e.g., color, shape, word). In simple experiments, each subject can see
all possible combinations of factors, and a statistical analysis of the
results is relatively straightforward. When the number of possible
combinations becomes too large for a simple crossing of all
possibilities, or when the relative order of different combinations of
factors is relevant to the hypothesis under test, then choosing a set of
stimuli to obtain statistically useful results can be more difficult.

In those more difficult cases, experimenters mostly write ad hoc scripts
to generate the stimuli for an experiment. Bugs in the scripts \-\--
either in the code or the ad-hoc approach used to generate combinations
\-\-- can mean that effort is wasted on experiments that cover a
statistically inclusive range. We are designing a language for
experiment design that generalizes a basic model of factors and
crossings and adds new constructs to impose constraints on the generated
stimuli. A key problem in the implementation is choosing uniformly from
the distribution of stimuli that satisfy the constraints; recent work on
uniform sampling of SAT formulae seems to be exactly the tool we need,
and we target that tool in the design of our constraint language.

#### []{#Heather_Miller_A_Programming_Mod} Heather Miller: A Programming Model and Foundation for Lineage-Based Distributed Computation

The most successful systems for "big data" processing have all adopted
functional APIs. We present a new programming model we call \"function
passing\" designed to provide a more principled substrate, or
middleware, upon which to build data-centric distributed systems like
Spark. A key idea is to build up a persistent functional data structure
representing transformations on distributed immutable data by passing
well-typed serializable functions over the wire and applying them to
this distributed data. Thus, the function passing model can be thought
of as a persistent functional data structure that is distributed, where
transformations performed on distributed data are stored in its nodes
rather than the distributed data itself. One advantage of this model is
that failure recovery is simplified by design--data can be recovered by
replaying function applications atop immutable data loaded from stable
storage. Deferred evaluation is also central to our model; by
incorporating deferred evaluation into our design only at the point of
initiating network communication, the function passing model remains
easy to reason about while remaining efficient in time and memory.
Moreover, we provide a complete formalization of the programming model
in order to study the foundations of lineage-based distributed
computation. In particular, we develop a theory of safe, mobile lineages
based on a subject reduction theorem for a typed core language.
Furthermore, we formalize a progress theorem which guarantees the finite
materialization of remote, lineage-based data. Thus, the formal model
may serve as a basis for further developments of the theory of
data-centric distributed programming, including aspects such as fault
tolerance.

#### []{#John_Regehr_Superoptimizing_LLVM} John Regehr: Superoptimizing LLVM

LLVM serves as an intermediate representation between several
programming languages and a number of target architectures. Although
LLVM already supports many IR-level optimizations, plenty of
optimizations have not yet been implemented. I\'ll talk about Souper, a
superoptimizer that automatically synthesizes new optimizations for
LLVM. Souper can also interact with some of LLVM\'s dataflow analyses,
both learning from them and finding situations where their precision can
be improved.

#### []{#Ross_Tate_Discussion_on_Method_O} Ross Tate: Discussion on Method Overloading

Method overloading is a feature of many major programming languages, one
which people have strong and varied opinions about. Rather than give a
talk on overloading, I will conduct a discussion to collect together our
experiences with this topic. The goal is not to decide whether method
overloading is good or bad, although hopefully from this discussion we
will all gain a broader understanding of the topic. Rather, the goal
beyond this collection is to identify potential avenues for variations
of method overloading that may achieve much of what a designer might
value in overloading while avoiding the many pitfalls of overloading
that a designer may or may not be aware of.

#### []{#Jan_Willem_Maessen_Derivatives_C} Jan-Willem Maessen: Derivatives, CPS, Defunctionalization, And Machine Learning ([Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1171A7ozFJ6TyJRCNsC8qabL9JfeNaheUW8loLRu09-s/view))

In machine learning, extensive use is made of reverse-mode automatic
differentiation to compute the gradient of model parameters with respect
to the value of a fitness function. This is typically done using a
\"tape\" model that logs forward operations and their results. In our
Athens meeting I got interested in the relationship between data type
derivatives and defunctionalized CPS transformations -- we can connect
the reified stack of our computations to data structures describing the
call structure of the program. This gives us the opportunity to
incrementalize computation and turn recursion into iteration in a very
general setting. Talking to Alex Woltzko at Google, it appears there may
be deep connections between the data capture performed by automatic
differentiation and the data structures of recursion removal. I\'ll talk
about my early explorations, and then broaden the discussion to
opportunities for PL designers to collaborate in machine learning
research.\
