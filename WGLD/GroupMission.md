Group Mission {#group-mission .twikiTopicTitle}
=============

::: {.twikiWebTitle}
Working Group on Language Design
:::

The mission of this group is to provide a forum for discussing
programming language design issues. We have noticed that researchers
interested in language design are isolated and lack a place to exchange
ideas and criticism. Computer science conferences no longer serve this
role, because they have become fixated on rigorous evaluation. There is
nothing wrong with rigorous evaluation of things that can be so
evaluated, but language design ideas, particularly in their formative
stages where feedback is most crucial --- when there may be neither
implementation nor experience with their use --- cannot be so evaluated.
Indeed, many landmark papers on language design could not be published
today: Liskov on data abstraction, or Parnas on modules, or Dijkstra on
**goto**. These papers consisted of reasoned arguments for the power of
a new idea. We aim to create a venue where such ideas and arguments are
welcome and where they can be refined by constructive criticism.

Ivan Chermayeff wrote *\"Design is directed toward human beings. To
design is to solve human problems by identifying them and executing the
best solution.\"* Programming languages are not just for instructing
computers --- they are a medium for expressing software designs and
communicating such designs to other human beings. Thus, an understanding
of the human element is a vital part of good language design. As a
result, programming language design is not just mathematics, science, or
engineering --- although it involves all of these. Other fields, like
Architecture, recognize Design (with a capital D) as a distinct practice
with its own methodologies. Steve Jobs wrote:

Good design finds a balance between conflicting goals that are
qualitative in nature. It requires insight, experience, and judgment; in
sum: good taste. We need to affirm what really matters about programming
languages, both to ourselves and the wider community.

For these reasons, this working group seeks to develop a balance between
the benefits of openness and diversity and the need to maintain a
high-quality membership and high-value conversations.\
