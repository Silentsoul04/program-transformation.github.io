Working Group on Language Design
:::

-   Dates: April 20-24 (Mon-Fri), 2015.
-   Venue: Athens, Greece
-   Host: Yannis Smaragdakis

[]{#Venue} Venue
----------------

The meeting will take place at the University of Athens Club (Kostis
Palamas building).

The
[venue](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kostis+Palamas+Building/@37.980608,23.735297,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x14a1bd39be980c43:0x1e5f0b58a779ac73)
is in downtown Athens, within a short walking distance of the Syntagma
square (the modern center of town).

The building offers an array of options for internet access (guest
access to the University network, eduroam) and a dining area for lunch.
An all-day coffee and pastries buffet will be available throughout.
Since laptop use during the meeting is discouraged, there will be a
designated time period every day for laptop-detox (e.g., catching up and
responding to urgent emails).

[]{#Accommodation} Accommodation
--------------------------------

There is an abundance of hotels in the area, at all price ranges. You
should prefer the areas south of the meeting venue, where most of the
hotels are anyway. See the attached map for the recommended area of your
hotel search. Location-wise, you will be well-served by any of the \~100
hotels in the shown map area. Even the furthest away hotels on this map
are within a half hour walk, or, equivalently, a 2-stop metro ride.

Sample picks:

-   Central Hotel (21 Apollonos St.): mid-range, good location for
    tourist areas, 1km to meeting venue.
-   Amalia Hotel (10 Amalias Ave.): mid-range+, very central, next to
    Syntagma Square, quite close to meeting venue (\<1km).
-   Divani Caravel (2 Vas. Alexandrou Ave.): mid-high range, a reliably
    high-quality Athens hotel, 2km to meeting venue.
-   Titania Hotel (52 Panepistimiou Ave. not in the map area):
    well-known 4-star hotel, very close to meeting venue (0.5km).
-   Grande Bretagne (Syntagma square): the top luxury hotel in downtown
    Athens, for those wanting to splurge. \<1km to meeting venue.

[]{#Registration} Registration
------------------------------

Registration is required, however fees will be collected at the meeting.
Please register by emailing Dimitris Galipos: <dgalipos@di.uoa.gr>.
Dimitris is in charge of all the meeting logistics.

The registration fee for the meeting is 180euros, which includes the
cost for the all-day coffee buffet and lunch buffet for 5 days, as well
as the cost of an excursion to the Acropolis. Dinners are not
included\--although we expect a planned group outing for dinner every
evening, pricing and payment arrangements will be made on the spot.

### []{#Sean_McDermid_Going_Against_the}[]{#Sean_McDermid_Going_Against_the_} Sean McDermid: Going Against the Flow for Type-less Programming

Object-oriented languages are plagued by poor support for type inference
given difficulty in combining subtype and parametric polymorphism. This
talk will introduce a Type-less type system that provides useful type
feedback about OO code with less type annotations. Type-less rethinks
type checking as a modular field-aware value flow analysis to allow
inference on assignment with simplified variance and binding. Type-less
also does type inference backwards to specializes term types based on
their usage rather than generalizing types to validate their usage. Type
annotations are then unnecessary in client code that does not define new
abstractions, and greatly reduced otherwise. The result is a fluid
programming experience whose feel approaches that of a dynamic language,
which I will demo, of course!

### []{#Adam_Chlipala_The_Ur_Web_People}[]{#Adam_Chlipala_The_Ur_Web_People_} Adam Chlipala: The Ur/Web People Organizer: A Library for Rapid Development of Web Apps from Components

I\'ll introduce a new library for the Ur/Web programming language that I
talked about at past meetings of this group. Ur/Web has some novel
features that support unusual and effective styles of encapsulation;
I\'ll review those a bit. The purpose of the talk, which will focus
heavily on code demos, is the new library, the Ur/Web People Organizer,
which is based on a component architecture that allows very rapid
assembly of applications for running meetings, etc. A growing set of
components encapsulate such ideas as scheduling meetings between two
groups of people, taking RSVPs for different subevents, etc. Each
component has a rich static type, expressing its polymorphic
dependencies on the schemas of selected SQL database tables.

### []{#Markus_V_lter_Experiences_from_b} Markus VÃ¶lter: Experiences from building mbeddr

Over the last four years a team at fortiss and itemis have built mbeddr,
an extensible set of integrated languages for embedded software
development. mbeddr relies on the
[JetBrains[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/JetBrains?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2015)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"} MPS language workbench. MPS\'
projectional editor enables wide-ranging language modularity and
flexible notations that include text, prose, tables, mathematics and
diagrams. As far as we know, mbeddr is the largest and most
sophisticated system built on top of a projectional language workbench.
In this talk I will **very briefly** show mbeddr and recap the \'mbeddr
experience\'. In particular, I will point out the problems we had to
fight with during mbeddr\'s construction, including those created by MPS
as well as those that resulted from our own ignorance. I will close the
talk by indentifying some of the areas in which MPS could be (or is
currently being) improved: some of them are certainly interesting topics
for academic research.

### []{#Roberto_Ierusalimschy_Integers_i} Roberto Ierusalimschy: Integers in Lua

Numerical support in programming languages is not a very glamorous
subject. Nevertheless, it is a fundamental aspect of any language, and
things are far from settled. Each new programming language comes with an
almost unique set of number representations and sizes, coercion rules,
overflow handling, etc.

Lua, unlike most other programming languages, offered only one numerical
representation, (double-precision) floating-point numbers. This approach
simplifies the language and also its implementation, and for many years
served the needs of the language.

However, in recent years, two trends changed that situation. One is the
spread of 64-bit machines, and with it the spread of 64-bit APIs,
algorithms, etc. The other is the increased embedding of Lua in small
devices and its use in the \"Internet of Things\". As a result, after
much deliberation, Lua 5.3 (released Jan 2015) has incorporated (64-bit)
integers. In this talk, I will discuss the process that led to this
change.

### []{#Matthew_Flatt_Binding_as_Sets_of} Matthew Flatt: Binding as Sets of Scopes

Hygienic macro expansion is usually described as a kind of translation
into lexical-scope machinery. In particular, variables must be
\"renamed\" to match the mechanisms of lexical scope as the variables
interact with macros. In a new macro expander for Racket, we discard the
renaming approach and start with a generalized idea of \"macro scope\",
where lexical scope is just a special case of macro scope when applied
to a language without macros. The resulting macro system has slightly
different properties than the old one, but purely pattern-based macros
work as before, and the vast majority of macros in existing Racket code
also continue to work. At the same time, the macro system is easier to
explain and specify than one based on renaming. The corresponding
implementation is simpler, and it avoids bugs that have proven too
difficult to repair in the current macro expander.

### []{#Yannis_Smaragdakis_Streams_a_la}[]{#Yannis_Smaragdakis_Streams_a_la_} Yannis Smaragdakis: Streams a la Carte: Extensible Pipelines with Object Algebras

Streaming libraries have become ubiquitous in object-oriented languages,
with recent offerings in Java, C\#, and Scala. All such libraries,
however, suffer in terms of extensibility: there is no way to change the
semantics of a streaming pipeline (e.g., to fuse filter operators, to
perform computations lazily, to log operations) without changes to the
library code. Furthermore, in some languages it is not even possible to
add new operators (e.g., a zip operator, in addition to the standard
map, filter, etc.) without changing the library.

We address such extensibility shortcomings with a new design for
streaming libraries, based on treating the library as a domain-specific
language interpreter. The architecture underlying this design borrows
heavily from Oliveira and Cook's object algebra solution to the
expression problem, extended with a design that exposes the push/pull
character of the iteration, and an encoding of higher-kinded
polymorphism. We apply our design to Java and show that the addition of
full extensibility is accompanied by high performance, matching or
exceeding that of the original, highly-optimized Java streams library.

### []{#Jonathan_Aldrich_On_the_Evaluati} Jonathan Aldrich: On the Evaluation of Language Designs

How does one evaluate a language design? Clearly there are multiple
modalities, including case studies, human subjects experiments,
benchmarking, code corpus studies, observational studies, etc. What are
the strengths and drawbacks of each? Are there examples of each in the
literature that we find exemplary? I will lead a structured discussion
aimed at coming to a preliminary consensus on some principles at the
meeting, and identifying a subgroup interested in turning the results
into a paper.

Because I am interested in starting an ongoing discussion, I would be
interested in giving my talk relatively early in the week. For example,
I will be prepared to give it the first day, if scheduling permits.

### []{#Andrew_Tolmach_A_Theory_of_Name}[]{#Andrew_Tolmach_A_Theory_of_Name_} Andrew Tolmach: A Theory of Name Resolution

Joint work with Pierre Neron, Eelco Visser and Guido Wachsmuth

We describe a language-independent theory for name binding and
resolution, suitable for programming languages with complex scoping
rules including both lexical scoping and modules. We formulate name
resolution as a two stage problem. First a language-independent scope
graph is constructed using language-specific rules from an abstract
syntax tree. Then references in the scope graph are resolved to
corresponding declarations using a language-independent resolution
process. We introduce a resolution calculus as a concise, declarative,
and language-independent specification of name resolution. We develop a
resolution algorithm that is sound and complete with respect to the
calculus. Based on the resolution calculus we develop
language-independent definitions of alpha-equivalence and rename
refactoring.

### []{#Klaus_Ostermann_Language_Design}[]{#Klaus_Ostermann_Language_Design_} Klaus Ostermann: Language Design by Duality: Making defunctionalization and refunctionalization symmetric

Reynold\'s defunctionalization and Danvy\'s refunctionalization
establish a correspondence between programming with first-class
functions and programming with pattern matching, but the correspondence
is not symmetric: Not all uses of pattern matching can be automatically
refunctionalized to uses of higher-order functions. This asymmetry makes
it hard to compare the two styles of programming or convert
automatically between them. We generalize from first-class functions to
arbitrary codata. This leads us to a pair of languages, one with codata
support based on Abel\'s copattern matching and one with data support
based on pattern matching. They support full defunctionalization and
refunctionalization.

### []{#Panagiotis_Rondogiannis_Extensio} Panagiotis Rondogiannis: Extensional Higher-Order Logic Programing

We present a purely extensional higher-order logic programming language.
In this language predicates denote sets, and two predicates are equal
iff they are equal as sets. Moreover, every program has a unique minimum
Herbrand model which is the greatest lower bound of all Herbrand models
of the program and the least fixed-point of an immediate consequence
operator. In other words, we provide a purely extensional theoretical
framework for higher-order logic programming which generalizes the
familiar theory of classical (first-order) logic programming. We discuss
an extension of the language which supports negation-as-failure, and
present its semantics.

### []{#Francisco_Sant_anna_Structured_S} Francisco Sant\'anna: Structured Synchronous Reactive Programming with CÃ©u

Structured synchronous reactive programming (SSRP) augments classical
structured programming (SP) with continuous interaction with the
environment. We advocate SSRP as viable in multiple domains of reactive
applications and propose a new abstraction mechanism for the synchronous
language CÃ©u: Organisms extend objects with an execution body that
composes multiple lines of execution to react to the environment
independently. Compositions bring structured reasoning to concurrency
and can better describe state machines typical of reactive applications.
Organisms are subject to lexical scope and automatic memory management
similar to stack-based allocation for local variables in SP. We show
that this model does not require garbage collection or a \"free\"
primitive in the language, eliminating memory leaks for organisms by
design.

### []{#Sam_Tobin_Hochstadt_Pycket_a_tra} Sam-Tobin Hochstadt: Pycket, a tracing JIT compiler for a functional language.

### []{#James_Cheney_Teaching_about_PL_D} James Cheney: Teaching (about) PL Design (Discussion)

My department\'s previous courses on functional programming and
operational semantics saw dwindling participation recently, leaving an
unsightly gap between the FP and OOP basics covered in the first two
years and the advanced courses taught in the fourth year. I am currently
facing the challenge (and opportunity) of developing a new PL course
aimed at 3rd year students, to fill this gap.

Following internal discussion, my current plan is to make language
design considerations (\"good\", \"bad\", tradeoffs) a unifying theme of
the course, and placing greater weight on practical experience
(interpreters, DSL implementation) and less on foundations (operational
semantics, specification, etc.) than our previous courses.

My totally selfish goal in this talk/discussion is to present the
context motivating my current plan and provoke the audience into helping
me refine and improve it; less selfishly I hope this will also lead to
some transferable insights or ideas about how to make PL ideas
(including the notion of, and evaluation/appreciation of PL designs, not
just isolated features or \"paradigms\") a central selling point of a
flagship PL course. If not, then at least it will be an amusing exercise
for the other WGLD participants to poke holes in my current plan.

### []{#Edwin_Brady_Uniqueness_Types_in}[]{#Edwin_Brady_Uniqueness_Types_in_} Edwin Brady: Uniqueness Types in Idris

I will present a newly implemented feature in the Idris programming
language, Uniqueness Types, and show how they can be used in practice to
implement programs with compile time guarantees on resource usage. They
are inspired by a similar feature in the Clean programming language, and
by Ownership Types in Rust.

A value with a uniqueness type can be used at most once in a program.
This means that once used, the memory they occupy can be safely
reallocated. Furthermore, it becomes possible to represent and reason
about state machines directly in types. I will discuss some of the
trade-offs in the design and present a practical example, namely
type-safe concurrent programming.

### []{#Sophia_Drossopoulou_Pony} Sophia Drossopoulou: Pony

The language Pony was developed with the aim to support easy concurrent
programming, fast implementations, and data-race freedom.

In terms of case studies and benchmarks, we argue that indeed, Pony
programs are fast. In terms of our and our collaborators' programming
experience, we argue that Pony is easy to learn and program in. We then
outline some salient features of the Pony type system, and the garbage
collection system.

### []{#Kostis_Sagonas_Type_Inference_ba} Kostis Sagonas: Type Inference based on Success Typings for Erlang: A Success?

Erlang is a concurrent functional programming language designed by
Ericsson to meet the needs of developing large-scale telecommunication
systems. It has been designed as a dynamically typed but type safe
language. For more than ten years now, Erlang is coming with static
analysis tools that perform aggressive type inference based on success
typings and a language for optional type declarations and function
specifications. In this talk we will try to discuss whether this
approach to adding types to a language designed to be dynamically typed
was a good or a bad one and the lessons that have been learned in the
process.

### []{#Gilad_Bracha_Implementing_Access} Gilad Bracha: Implementing Access Control In Newspeak

(joint work with Ryan Macnak)

There is a natural affinity between object-based encapsulation and
capability-based security. The Newspeak programming language capitalizes
on this affinity. However, until recently Newspeak did not enforce
access control. This is changing, and provides a clean basis for
building a secure, object-capability based system.

I'll discuss the Newspeak access control semantics and our ongoing
experience in implementing and using them.

### []{#Roly_Perera_Demand_indexed_compu} Roly Perera: Demand-indexed computation

I\'ll talk about an idea that came out of the work on program slicing
that I did for my
[PhD[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/PhD?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2015)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"}.

An important role of GUIs is to provide control over the *demand* active
on the output of a computation, via widgets like scrollpanes,
collapsible lists, and tooltips. This usually means computing all the
output upfront and then hiding some of it, or computing it as needed
using ad hoc, application-specific logic.

A somewhat independent observation is that pattern-matching imposes a
demand on the thing being pattern-matched: for example a function
defined by a set of equations needs to know something (but typically not
everything) about the argument in order to decide which of its defining
equations is applicable.

\"Tries\" (a.k.a. prefix trees), extended with a notion of variable
binding, can be used to formalise both of these notions of demand. I\'ll
outline an operational semantics for a simple functional language where
the demand on the output is specified explicitly in the form of a trie
of a suitable type. Running the same program with more demand produces
correspondingly more output. I plan to extend this with a notion of
\"differential\" trie, representing a change in demand, plus a
differential operational semantics which, given an increase in demand,
does just enough extra work to produce the required extra output.
Although I haven\'t worked this bit out yet, I\'ll try to explain the
idea with several examples.

### []{#Ross_Tate_Collaborating_with_Cey} Ross Tate: Collaborating with Ceylon and Kotlin

I have been collaborating with the Ceylon team at Red Hat and the Kotlin
team at
[JetBrains[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/JetBrains?topicparent=WGLD.Meeting2015)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"} for approximately 4 years now. In these
collaborations, I have not designed any languages; rather I have helped
these teams make their designs have the properties that they want. In
this process, I have come to understand their underlying design
philosophies, many of which are motivated by their development
experiences as well as what they perceive to be necessary for industry
adoption. I will present my personal understanding of their
perspectives, while focusing on aspects that may generalize to other
industry language designs. Whether those aspects actually generalize
will hopefully prompt lively discussion.

I will give an account of my 9-year work on mining large repositories of
code towards the goal of producing the ultimate \"do what I mean\"
programming environment. I will cover the lessons learned, both positive
and not-so-positive. These lessons raise some interesting questions for
programming language design.

### []{#Eelco_Visser_Dynamic_Semantics_S} Eelco Visser: Dynamic Semantics Specification in DynSem

In this talk I demonstrate the design of the DynSem language for the
specification of dynamic semantics. From DynSem specifications we
generate interpreter implementations in Java, which are integrated in
the IDE for the object language generated by the Spoofax Language
Workbench.

### []{#James_Noble_Swapsies_on_the_Inte} James Noble: Swapsies on the Internet - First Steps towards Reasoning about Risk and Trust in an Open World

Contemporary open systems use components developed by many different
parties, linked together dynamically in unforeseen constellations. Code
needs to live up to strict security specifications: it has to ensure the
correct functioning of its objects when they collaborate with external
objects of unknown provenance, and it has to protect its objects'
integrity even when external objects are malicious.

In this talk we propose specification concepts to model risk and trust
in such open systems. We use these concepts to specify the escrow
exchange example, and discuss the meaning of such a specification.
We\'ll argue informally that the code satisfies its specification
