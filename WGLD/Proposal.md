Working Group on Language Design
:::

We have organized a group to discuss programming language design and
propose to become an IFIP TC2 working group. While the theory and
implementation of programming languages are both well developed fields
with strong institutions, there is currently less acknowledgement and
support for work on the design of programming languages. We take the
position that programming languages are not just a notation for
instructing a computer --- they are a medium for expressing the
structure and intention of software and communicating these to other
programmers. Thus human factors must weigh heavily in language design
decisions, requiring a well-judged balance between conflicting goals
that are qualitative in nature. Other fields, like Architecture, call
such balancing acts Design, with a capital D, and recognize this
activity as a practice with its own methodologies, distinct from both
science and engineering.

Ivan Chermayeff wrote \"Design is directed toward human beings. To
design is to solve human problems by identifying them and executing the
best solution.\" Steve Jobs wrote: \"In most people\'s vocabularies,
design means veneer. It\'s interior decorating. It\'s the fabric of the
curtains or the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the
meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a human-made
creation.\" We feel that this notion of design captures the essential
difficulty of creating useful programming languages. Design issues are
what programming language developers argue about amongst themselves. We
have formed a working group of experts active in programming language
research and development that is focused on discussion at the design
level.

Our reason for forming a new group is that there is no existing venue
that brings together experts to exchange and refine new ideas in
programming language design. Computer science conferences no longer
serve this role, because they are dedicated to the presentation of
contributions that have been rigorously evaluated. While such
conferences serve a crucial role in scientific progress, they tend to
filter out discussion of early stage ideas as well as design issues that
are qualitative in nature. Neither do they facilitate conversations on
open problems and emerging issues. We note that some of the landmark
papers on language design could not be published today: Liskov on data
abstraction, Parnas on modules, or Landin on the next 700 languages.
These papers consisted of informal but carefully reasoned arguments for
the power of a new idea. These ideas were communicated promptly and
triggered vibrant debates. We seek a venue that cultivates such ideas,
arguments, and debates in a concentrated setting with a cohesive group
of researchers and developers.

We have chosen to propose a new TC2 working group for two reasons.
First, TC2 working groups are a proven model that has provided great
benefit to our field, and indeed to some of us who are members of
existing groups. Secondly, we feel that our charter complements the
existing range of working groups. Groups such as WG 2.4 (Software
Implementation Languages) and WG 2.8 (Functional Programming) specialize
in specific kinds of programming languages. We believe it is vital to
also have a forum that cross-fertilizes perspectives from the entire
spectrum of programming language paradigms and communities, and that the
lack of such communication has led in the past to wasteful intellectual
duplication. Our initial membership already represents OO (static,
dynamic, and Scandinavian), FP, distributed, parallel, LISP family,
Java, C\#,
[JavaScript[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/WGLD/JavaScript?topicparent=WGLD.Proposal)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"}. We intend to deepen and broaden this
coverage as we fill out the initial membership.

WG 2.1 (Algorithmic Languages and Calculi) covers all programming
languages, focusing on their formal aspects. In so doing they
necessarily de-emphasize discussion of informal and qualitative design
issues. We believe that sound theory is a necessary foundation for
successful design work. Conversely, we would welcome the opportunity to
bring emerging topics to the attention of WG 2.1 when there is a need
for more formal investigation of a significant new idea. We might play
an opposite role with WG 2.3 (Programming Methodology), designing
language features in support of their methodological proposals. In this
sense, we fill the gap between WG 2.1 and WG 2.3.

In sum, while our group overlaps to some extent with the subject areas
of existing working groups, we differ more on an orthogonal axis, that
of method. Our focus on design tempers the methods of mathematics and
engineering with an appreciation of the pervasive influence of human
factors throughout the act of programming. We feel the need to shift the
discourse in this direction in order to progress as programming language
researchers and developers. We further hope that this also is a step
towards bridging the unfortunate chasm between industry and academic
computer science. The charter of TC2 is "Software: Theory and Practice".
We respectfully submit that our group would help TC2 more completely
fulfill that charter.

Our inaugural meeting was held June 1-3 2011 preceding PLDI, hosted by
Google in Mountain View CA USA. A report on this meeting is attached. To
summarize, we left the meeting with a consensus that it was a uniquely
valuable experience and with the intention to proceed in formalizing the
group, our first choice being an IFIP TC2 working group. The next
meeting will be in the Summer of 2012, either at Imperial College in
London or colocated with ECOOP in Beijing. Longer term, we are
considering colocating on a regular basis with OOPSLA or ECOOP, and also
sponsoring an associated workshop at those venues.

We thank the TC2 committee for entertaining this proposal and look
forward to discussing its merits at the upcoming annual meeting.\
