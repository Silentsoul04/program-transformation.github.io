[]{#Manifesto} Manifesto
------------------------

-   From: Jonathan Edwards

-   Subject: Working Group on Programming Language Design

A few of us feel that there is currently no good forum for discussing
programming language design issues; researchers interested in language
design are isolated and lack a place to exchange ideas and criticism.
Computer science conferences no longer serve this role, because they
have become fixated on rigorous evaluation. There is nothing wrong with
rigorous evaluation of things that can be so evaluated, but language
design ideas, particularly in their formative stages where feedback is
most crucial --- and when there may be neither implementation nor
experience with their use --- cannot be so evaluated. Indeed, many
landmark papers on language design could not be published today: Liskov
on data abstraction, or Parnas on modules, or Dijkstra on goto. These
papers consisted of reasoned arguments for the power of a new idea. We
need a venue where such ideas and arguments are still welcome and where
they can be refined by constructive criticism.

Ivan Chermayeff wrote \"Design is directed toward human beings. To
design is to solve human problems by identifying them and executing the
best solution.\" Programming languages are not just for instructing
computers --- they are a medium for expressing software designs and
communicating such designs to other programmers. Thus, an understanding
of the human element is a vital part of good language design. As a
result, programming language design is not just mathematics, science, or
engineering --- although it involves all of these. Other fields, like
Architecture, recognize Design (with a capital D) as a distinct practice
with its own methodologies. Steve Jobs wrote: \"In most people\'s
vocabularies, design means veneer. It\'s interior decorating. It\'s the
fabric of the curtains or the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further
from the meaning of design. Design is the fundamental soul of a
human-made creation.\" Good design finds a balance between conflicting
goals that are qualitative in nature. It requires insight, experience,
and judgment; in sum: good taste. We need to affirm what really matters
about programming languages, both to ourselves and the wider community.

For these reasons, the venue that we wish to develop must balance the
benefits of openness and diversity against the need to maintain a
high-quality membership and high-value conversations. A proven structure
is that of an IFIP working group, with a slowly evolving permanent
membership and a number of invited visitors, explicitly managed to
maintain a high quality of discourse. Indeed, we have asked a number of
WG members to suggest improvements to this formula, and they could not.

For these reasons we are considering proposing to IFIP Technical
Committee 2 (Software: Theory and Practice) the creation of a new
working group on Programming Language design. We would like to propose
you as one of the initial members of this group.

Our first cut at the aims and scope of this incipient group are as
follows.

AIMS

To explore and evaluate new ideas in the field of programming language
design.

SCOPE

-   the exploration of programming paradigms and major language
    features, both established and novel
-   the design of notations for such paradigms and features;
-   the design of programming environments that support the use of such
    notations;
-   the investigation of software systems that implement such program
    notations;
-   the evaluation of the above paradigms, designs and implementations,
    and
-   the promulgation of \"design thinking\" among researchers,
    practitioners, students and teachers.

IFIP WGs typically meet for a week once every 11 to 13 months; there are
no papers or proceedings, although papers often develop later from the
discussions and presentations at the meeting. Please let us know whether
or not you are interested in being part of such a group.
