-   Author notification: July 7, 2014

### []{#Scope} Scope

Generative and component approaches and domain-specific abstractions are
revolutionizing software development just as automation and
componentization revolutionized manufacturing. Raising the level of
abstraction in software specification has been a fundamental goal of the
computing community for several decades. Key technologies for automating
program development and lifting the abstraction level closer to the
problem domain are **Generative Programming** for program synthesis,
**Domain-Specific Languages** (DSLs) for compact problem-oriented
programming notations, and corresponding **Implementation Technologies**
aiming at modularity, correctness, reuse, and evolution. As the field
matures **Applications** and **Empirical Results** are of increasing
importance.

The International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts &
Experiences (GPCE) is a venue for researchers and practitioners
interested in techniques that use program generation, domain-specific
languages, and component deployment to increase programmer productivity,
improve software quality, and shorten the time-to-market of software
products. In addition to exploring cutting-edge techniques of generative
software, our goal is to foster further cross-fertilization between the
software engineering and the programming languages research communities.

### []{#Topics} Topics

GPCE seeks contributions on all topics related to generative software
and its properties. As technology is maturing, this year, we are
particularly looking for empirical evaluations in this context. Key
topics include (but are certainly not limited too):

-   Generative software
    -   **Domain-specific languages**\
        (language extension, language embedding, language design,
        language theory, language workbenches, interpreters, compilers)
    -   **Product lines**\
        (domain engineering, feature-oriented and aspect-oriented
        programming, preprocessors, feature interactions)
    -   **Metaprogramming**\
        (reflection, staging, partial evaluation)
    -   **Program synthesis**
    -   **Implementation techniques** and tool support\
        (components, plug-ins, libraries, metaprogramming, macros,
        templates, generic programming, run-time code generation,
        model-driven development, composition tools, code-completion and
        code-recommendation systems)
-   Properties of generative software
    -   **Correctness** of generators and generated code\
        (analysis, testing, formal methods, domain-specific error
        messages, safety, security)
    -   **Reuse** and **evolution**
    -   **Modularity**, separation of concerns, understandability, and
        maintainability
    -   **Performance** engineering, nonfunctional properties\
        (program optimization and parallelization, GPGPUs, multicore,
        footprint, metrics)
    -   **Application** areas and engineering practice\
        (distributed systems, middleware, embedded systems, patterns,
        development methods)
-   **Empirical evaluations** of all topics above\
    (user studies, substantial case studies, controlled experiments,
    surveys, rigorous measurements)

We particularly welcome papers that address some of the key challenges
in field, for example

-   Synthesizing code from declarative specifications
-   Supporting extensible languages and language embedding
-   Ensuring correctness and other nonfunctional properties of generated
    code; proving generators correct
-   Improving error reporting with domain-specific error messages
-   Reasoning about generators; handling variability-induced complexity
    in product lines
-   Providing efficient interpreters and execution languages
-   Human factors in developing and maintaining generators

**Note on empirical evaluations:** GPCE is committed to the empirical
evaluation of generative software. Publishing empirical papers at
programming-language venues can be challenging. We understand the
frustration of authors when, for example, reviews simply recommend
repeating entire experiments with human subjects with slight deviations
in execution. To alleviate such problems, we have recruited forto
program committee experts who routinely work with empirical methods, and
we will actively seek external reviews where appropriate. During
submissions, authors can optionally indicate that a paper contains
substantial empirical work, and we will endeavor have to the paper
reviewed by experts familiar with the empirical research methods that
are used in the paper. The program-committee discussions will reflect on
both technical contributions and research methods. For more context, see
also [\_Hints for Reviewing Empirical Work in Software
Engineering\_](http://www.springerlink.com/content/rr70j282h2k01960/).

**Policy:** Incremental improvements over previously published work
should have been evaluated through systematic, comparative, empirical,
or experimental evaluation. Submissions must adhere to SIGPLAN\'s
republication policy (<http://www.sigplan.org>). Please contact the
program chair if you have any questions about how this policy applies to
your paper (<chairs@gpce.org>).

Submitted articles must not have been previously published or currently
be submitted for publication elsewhere. The program chairs will apply
the principles of the ACM Plagiarism Policy throughout the submission
and review process.

### []{#Submissions} Submissions

The submission site is
<http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gpce14>.

#### []{#Research_papers} Research papers

**10 pages in SIGPLAN proceedings style** (sigplanconf.cls, default font
size, see <http://www.sigplan.org/authorInformation.htm>) reporting
original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual,
or experimental research that contribute to scientific knowledge in the
areas listed below (the PC chair can advise on appropriateness).

Authors may choose to submit a paper as **short paper of 4 pages** or
less. The goal of short papers is to promote current work on research
and practice. Short papers represent an early communication of research
and do not always require complete results as in the case of a full
paper. In this way, authors can introduce new ideas to the community,
discuss ideas and get early feedback. Please note that short papers are
not intended to be position statements. Short papers are included in the
proceedings and will be presented with a shorter time slot at the
conference.

Papers will be administratively rejected and will not be reviewed if
they exceed the page limit or use condensed formatting.

#### []{#Tool_demonstrations} Tool demonstrations

Tool demonstrations should present tools that implement generative
techniques, and are available for use. Any of the GPCE topics of
interest are appropriate areas for tool demonstrations, although purely
commercial tool demonstrations will not be accepted. Submissions have
must provide a tool description of **4 pages in SIGPLAN proceedings
style** (see above) and a demonstration outline including screenshots of
up to 4 pages. Tool demonstrations must have the words "Tool Demo" or
"Tool Demonstration" in the title, possibly appended in parenthesis. The
4-page tool description will, if the demonstration is accepted, be
published in the proceedings. The 4-page demonstration outline will be
used by the program committee only for evaluating the submission.

#### []{#Tech_talks} Tech talks

Depending on whether there is space in the program, GPCE may solicit
Tech talks. See the [GPCE\'12 tech talks call for
contributions](http://program-transformation.org/GPCE12/CallForTechTalks)
for details. For now, if you are interested in presenting a Tech talk,
please contact the chairs (<chairs@gpce.org>).

#### []{#Workshops} Workshops

Workshops will be organized by ASE. Please inform us (<chairs@gpce.org>)
**and** contact the ASE organizers if you would like to organize a
workshop of interest to the GPCE audience.
