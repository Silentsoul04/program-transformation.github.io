### []{#Overview} Overview

GPCE workshops provide intensive collaborative environments where
generative and component technology researchers and practitioners meet
to discuss and solve challenging problems facing the field.

We encourage proposals for innovative, well-focused workshops on a broad
spectrum of component engineering and generative programming topics. All
topics related to the theme of the conference are potential candidates
for workshops. Workshops typically fall into the following categories:

-   A workshop may address a specific sub-area of generative and
    component technology in depth.
-   A workshop may cover areas that cross the borders of several sub
    areas. Workshops that cross the borders of the formal and the
    applied areas is one example.
-   A workshop may focus on the application and deployment of generative
    and/or component technology in areas such as telecommunications,
    mobile computing or real-time systems. Workshops reporting on
    industrial experiences are particularly welcome.

Workshop topics are by no means limited to the categories mentioned
above. However, in each case, the proposed area is supposed to have
enough impetus to yield new results that can be considered important and
worth more detailed investigation.

### []{#Submission_Format} Submission Format

Workshop proposals should be sent in ASCII or PDF format to the workshop
chairs and should consist of the following four parts:

1\. Cover Page

-   Name of the proposed workshop.
-   Names and addresses of the organizers.
-   Intended number of participants.
-   Requested Audio/Video equipment.

2\. Abstract

-   Why is the proposed workshop relevant to GPCE? The abstract should
    provide a short overview of the rationale for the workshop and the
    major topics. In particular, statements about the review process and
    ways to ensure creativity during the workshop would be appreciated.
-   The abstract should preferably not exceed 200 words.

3\. Call for Participation

-   A preliminary version of the Call for Participation that the
    organizers must prepare if the workshop is accepted.
-   Should provide a brief overview of the proposed workshop including a
    description of the goals of the workshops and the work practices.
-   May repeat some of the statements made on the abstract page, but
    should be targeted specifically to potential workshop participants.

4\. Organizers Bio and Past Events

-   Short biography of each organizer.
-   References to similar workshops organized at previous conferences,
    including the number of participants.
-   If a workshop is accepted, the organizers will be requested to
    prepare a WWW page that will contain the latest information about
    the workshop. The web pages of each workshop will be linked to the
    GPCE workshop web site.
-   Each workshop must have at least two organizers, preferably from
    different organizations.

Please keep complete submissions to under four pages.

### []{#Recommendations} Recommendations

1\. Workshop organizers should foster the creative potential that is
tentatively present in a workshop.

2\. Remember that a workshop is NOT a conference!

3\. The success of a workshop depends greatly on the results generated
on-site.

4\. A number of interrelated issues should be taken into account in order
to provide a good framework for such on-site creativity.

5\. Presentation selection

-   Quality should obviously be the primary criterion for selecting the
    presentations.
-   However, in order for a workshop to be productive, consider also
    having presentations on some new, controversial topics to spark
    discussion.

Workshop proceedings can be printed in Tallinn provided they are
delivered in camera-ready form by **Aug 19, 2005**.

Workshop attendance will be manage via the GPCE registration form. There
will be a small workshop registration fee for participants registered to
the main conference, and a higher fee for the other participants.
Workshop organizers and presenters are required to register to the
workshop.

### []{#Submission_Process} Submission Process

Electronic submission of proposals must be sent to
<workshops05@gpce.org>. Proposals must be submitted no later than **Feb
25, 2005**, BUT EARLIER IS BETTER, as it allows for a more satisfactory
coordination between workshop proposals.

The submitted proposals will be reviewed collectively by the Workshop
Committee to determine a high quality and appropriate mix for the
conference.

### []{#For_More_Information} For More Information

For additional information, clarification, or questions please feel free
to contact the Workshop Chairs (<workshops05@gpce.org>).
