Program-Transformation.Org: The Program Transformation Wiki
:::

You can use this page to give your opinions on this Wiki: tell us what
you think!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [ReengineeringWiki](ReengineeringWiki){.twikiLink} is rather
incomplete and biased towards the current users. This will always be the
case.

However, anyone is invited to join and add subjects of interest to him
or her.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Viewing [ReverseEngineering](ReverseEngineering){.twikiLink} as
[ProgramTransformation](ProgramTransformation){.twikiLink} feels a bit
odd.

Indeed, I hesitated a bit in putting it under the
[http://www.program-transformation.org/](../index.html) umbrella.
However, there is so much in common, and there were already so many
program transformation pages, that I felt it was a shame not to take
advantage of these.

Moreover, it\'s not *that* strange.
[HelmutPartsch](HelmutPartsch){.twikiLink}, for example, sees
[ForwardEngineering](ForwardEngineering){.twikiLink} as a series of
transformations between programs. He starts with a high-level
specification, which gradually is transformed into executable code.
[ReverseEngineering](ReverseEngineering){.twikiLink} then really is the
reverse of this process: a series of transformations on program
representations in order to find the most abstract one.

This is, in fact, also the point of view taken by, for example
[IraBaxter](IraBaxter){.twikiLink}\'s DMS%20Toolkit approach, and
[JimNeighbors](JimNeighbors){.twikiLink}\' Draco approach.

\--ArieVanDeursen

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Very short pages, with just a name, a one line description, and a
[URL](URL){.twikiLink} tend not be very useful \-- if you want such info
you might as well want to \"google it up\".

Nevertheless, there can be good reasons to create such very short pages:

-   As an \"invitation\" to discuss, or share experience with the actual
    use of the topic / concept / paper / tool etc.
-   As a convenience to the reader, providing up-to-date
    [URLs](URL){.twikiLink}
-   As a way to eliminate too many questionmarks

\--ArieVanDeursen

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The current wiki technology used is not very strong:

-   The titles could be \"unconcatenated\", in order to get better
    readability and search engine results
-   The wiki doesn\'t support file \"attachements\"
-   Searching gets slower and slower
-   The list [WebChanges](WebChanges){.twikiLink} could perhaps be split
    into smaller chunks
-   Other Wiki\'s use cookies to find out that
    [ArieVanDeursen](ArieVanDeursen){.twikiLink} is editing rather than
    galjas.cwi.nl \-- that can be quite nice.
-   Editing pages and waiting for the reload takes too long (but not
    waiting might kill the cvs action
    [LeonMoonen](LeonMoonen){.twikiLink} mentioned)
    -   we might use the cron to put things under [CVS](CVS){.twikiLink}
        regularly
    -   we might use the cron to compute the backlinks rather than using
        the webserver (this means they won\'t be effective immediately).
-   The use of frames annoyingly interferes with bookmarking pages of
    interest.
    -   If we use frames, they must be wiki-editable
    -   The titlebar frame and the left frame overlap in data
    -   I\'d prefer generating wiki pages with default two buttons on
        the top, one for the entrypoint, and one for
        program-transformation.org. (and perhaps some buttons on the
        bottom for wiki-related stuff such as editing, searching,
        adding, \...)
-   The webserver used for running the wiki is a local one running on
    [CWI](CWI){.twikiLink} machine vanille port 8080. I think it\'s
    better to have it run on a more regular [CWI](CWI){.twikiLink} htbin
    directory (www.cwi.nl/htbin/\<user\>/)

I would rather have a Java-based fully
[OpenSource](OpenSource){.twikiLink} wiki which of all us can modify if
we want to.

\--ArieVanDeursen

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe it is time for [WikiRenovation](WikiRenovation){.twikiLink} then.
\-- [EelcoVisser](EelcoVisser){.twikiLink}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The transition to Twiki has resolved many of these issues: the only open
one is that bookmarking through program-transformation.org is not yet
possible (such [URLs](URL){.twikiLink} point to the losser instead).
Eelco is sorting this out and has a solution.

\-- [ArieVanDeursen](ArieVanDeursen){.twikiLink} \-- 04 Apr 2001

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The distinction between the subwebs is not immediately clear.

-   There seems to be potential overlap between the Tools and the
    Transform web in particular.
-   The migration from vanille to the splitted subwebs has created
    several broken links

I\'m in favor of merging the subwebs together: the various entry points
can then easily share information.

\-- [ArieVanDeursen](ArieVanDeursen){.twikiLink} - 25 Apr 2001\

I\'m not in favour. Sharing of information is easy enough and is already
being done. Whenever you want to refer to
[ProgramTransformation](ProgramTransformation){.twikiLink} in the
Stratego or Tools web, write Transform.ProgramTransformation. Topics in
the Tools web are different in nature from topics in the Transform web.
But something needs to be done about visualization of the site
structure. For instance, generating a graph picture showing relations
between (a selection of) the pages.

\-- [EelcoVisser](../Main/EelcoVisser){.twikiLink} - 14 Oct 2001\

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It would be nice to see how mature a particular page is. This could be a
color coding / icon attached to a link, so that you can decide whether
to visit this page or not.

This would require some technical Twiki modification, though..

\-- [ChrisVerhoef](ChrisVerhoef){.twikiLink} &
[ArieVanDeursen](ArieVanDeursen){.twikiLink}, dierendag 2001.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I would like to get automatic notification of changes to page I
contributed to.

\-- [PeggyStorey](PeggyStorey){.twikiLink}

You can get daily notification of changes to a web by putting your name
and email address on the [WebNotify](WebNotify){.twikiLink} page.
Notifications are sent out on a daily basis.

\-- [EelcoVisser](../Main/EelcoVisser){.twikiLink} - 14 Oct 2001\

What\'s meant here is not an (almost daily) message with all pages that
are changed, but just message for those pages that were once in their
history edited by the subscribing person (a more refined notification)
\-- [ArieVanDeursen](ArieVanDeursen){.twikiLink}. - 14 Oct 2001\

Yes, I understood that, but just thought it would be good to point out
the [WebNotify](WebNotify){.twikiLink} possibility, which I find a
useful way of keeping track of what is going on at the wiki. \--
[EelcoVisser](../Main/EelcoVisser){.twikiLink} - 15 Oct 2001\

It\'s not ideal, but I just check the Transform Changes link every
couple of days. I run my eye down the topic names, looking for topics
that I have contributed to, or of course any topics of interest. It\'s a
sort of \"automatic what\'s new\". Every now and then, you will find
just a cosmetic change, but if you have the time, it\'s not a bad
technique. \-- [MikeVanEmmerik](../Main/MikeVanEmmerik){.twikiLink} - 30
Dec 2001

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I find the preferences, variables etc. a bit complicated. Well, I just
don\'t get it. ;-) I would prefer more simplicity like in the original
Wiki at c2.com.

Something is missing! There are no typical
[ThreadMode](ThreadMode){.twikiLink}
(<http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ThreadMode>) dicusssions here!? What to do
about it?

\--
[FrankGerhardt[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/Main/FrankGerhardt?topicparent=Transform.GuestBook)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"}

You don\'t have to use any of the more complicated stuff. \--
[EelcoVisser](EelcoVisser){.twikiLink}

*Twiki has many bells and whistles that are distracting \-- I\'d like to
get rid of them* \-- [ArieVanDeursen](ArieVanDeursen){.twikiLink}.

[ThreadMode](ThreadMode){.twikiLink} isn\'t used much yet since the
community is still rather small.
[ArieVanDeursen](ArieVanDeursen){.twikiLink} and
[EelcoVisser](EelcoVisser){.twikiLink} have been the main contributors
until now. But this page is starting to look like it is in
[ThreadMode](ThreadMode){.twikiLink}. It might even be time to split of
some topics from this page. \--
[EelcoVisser](../Main/EelcoVisser){.twikiLink} - 14 Oct 2001\

*Many pages have a survey-like character. This makes it a bit difficult
to disagree with the contents, making
[ThreadMode](ThreadMode){.twikiLink} less likely. I think it would be
nicer to have more personal / opiniated pages as well* \--
[ArieVanDeursen](ArieVanDeursen){.twikiLink} - 14 Oct 2001\

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Main web ([Main](../Main/WebHome){.twikiLink}) of this twiki was
intended for discussions on
[HouseKeeping[^?^](http://www.program-transformation.org/edit/Main/HouseKeeping?topicparent=Transform.GuestBook)]{.twikiNewLink
style="background : #FFFFCE;"} matters. How about moving the topics on
this page there?

\-- [EelcoVisser](../Main/EelcoVisser){.twikiLink} - 14 Oct 2001\
