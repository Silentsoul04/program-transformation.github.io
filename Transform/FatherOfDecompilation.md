  **Professor Halstead is best known for his work in Software Science, an experimental and theoretical discipline concerned with measuring properties of computer programs. In the 1960s he wrote one of the first books on compiler implementation.**

Maurice Halstead, referred to fondly as Maury, received a BA degree in
physics-meteorology from the University of California, Berkeley in 1940,
an MS degree in aerological engineering from the Naval Academy
Postgraduate School, Annapolis, MD in 1943, and a PhD degree in physical
science from Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD in 1951. His
[resume](DeCompResume){.twikiLink} describes his professional career.

\"Maury was a true experimental scientist, pioneer and visionary in the
field of computer software. At a time when software developers were
still arguing about the viability of higher level languages, Maury
committed part of the resources of a Navy development project to create
the first self-compiling compiler (Neliac) which was then used to
complete the project on time and within budget. At another time, with a
team of 30 people working on the Global Weather conversion project
apparently in schedule trouble, he took the gamble to cut the project
team staff in half (rather than increasing the staff). The project was
completed on time due to releasing the productive members\' time to
productive work rather than assisting junior members with their
problems.

\"Maury\'s background in physics, meteorology and the physical sciences
provided him with insights and interests that ultimately led to the
development of software metrics which he initially called \'Software
Thermodynamics.\'

\"As a boss, Maury could be the epitome of a father figure: he was
supportive, interested, and always made a person feel like the ideas
that he fed to them were their own (at least this was the case for me).
He could also be an aggressive politician and created enemies as well as
friends as a player in the development of computing capabilities of the
U.S. Navy.\"

The following sections describe three decompilation projects for a
variety of machines. The aim of these decompiler projects was to aid in
the migration of software to newer/successor machines, hence eliminating
part of the time consuming task of rewriting code for the new machines.
\"A primary requirement was to be able to decompile from binary (or more
specifically using binary card images as input).\"

### []{#The_D_Neliac_Decompiler_1960_U_S} The D-Neliac Decompiler (1960, U. S. Navy Electronic Labs)

The Neliac language was developed at the U. S. Navy Electronic Labs
(NEL) in 1958 to support a Navy systems project. The compiler was
developed to reduce the increasing costs of these systems which
previously used assembler/machine language. Prior to the first
decompiler, the first Neliac compiler was written in assembler by Maury
and Lieutenant John White, and perhaps others. The first self-compiling
Neliac compiler was written by Ensign A. E. Lemay. Neliac was a dialect
of Algol 58. Neliac supported low-level code as well as high-level
language constructs. These first compilers for the language were
developed in 1958-9 under the direction of Maury Halstead.

In 1960, Maury directed a project on decompilation mainly to show the
usefulness of the Neliac language as a Universal Computer Oriented
Language, as well as a problem-oriented language. Joel Donnelly and
Herman Englander implemented the D-Neliac decompiler for the Univac
M-460 Countess Computer while on Maury\'s staff. \"Each time Joel would
bring an \'impossibility\' to Maury, they would sit down and figure a
way around it.\" As Herm noted, \"the difficult we do immediately \--
the impossible takes a little longer.\" The D-Neliac decompiler was an
operational decompiler that decompiled Univac M-460 binary code into
Neliac source code. There was also a CDC 1604 version of D-Neliac.

In the summer of 1962, Bill joined NEL and worked for Maury developing
an earth atmosphere simulation program. After returning to NMSU for one
more year of graduate studies, Bill returned to NEL in 1963.

### []{#The_IBM_7094_to_Univac_1108_Neli} The IBM 7094 to Univac 1108 Neliac Decompiler (1963-7, Lockheed Missiles and Space)

With Maury\'s move to Lockheed in the fall of 1963, and with the
introduction of newer and faster machines, the IBM 360 and the Univac
1108, Lockheed planned to move its scientific applications to the Univac
1108 and its business applications to the IBM 360. The conversion to
1108 was done via decompilation to Neliac of assembler programs and
LIFT/SIFT of Fortran programs. The conversion to IBM 360 was by manual
conversion and 360 emulation of IBM 7094/1401/1410 programs.

\"The first version of the IBM 7094 to Neliac Decompiler was from IBM
7094 binary card images to IBM 7094 Neliac. Then, after the Univac
1107-8 compiler was bootstrapped from the IBM 7094 version, the
decompiler was modified to translate to Univac 1108 Neliac. Since the
resulting programs were running on a different system and instruction
set, we did not have the luxury of inserting crutch code (i.e., machine
code), even though Neliac allowed it. What we did do, however, was to
modify the Neliac compiler, which we then called the Neliac
\"recompiler\", to compile in ways to assist the correct operation of
the decompiled code. One of these was the order of evaluation of
arithmetic. That was one of the first tasks I accomplished after
enhancing the Neliac compiler to include compilation of algebraic
expressions and exponentiation. The original compiler allowed only very
simple arithmetic. The recompiler used this simpler, and predictable,
order of evaluation. This allowed such idioms as the conversion of
integer to floating point to work as they had on the IBM 7094 (where the
conversion was performed by a load of the integer, ORing the result with
a floating point exponent, followed by a floating point add of zero). Of
course, maintaining the order of arithmetic is sometimes important, and
that was the primary emphasis of the recompiler.\"

Original team members of the advanced software development group working
for Maury on the Neliac compiler and decompiler projects included: Bill
Caudle, Lambert Lui and Gordon Pelton on the decompiler; Bob Stelloh and
Alan Howard on the compiler. Al Fuhrman developed the Neliac
compressor/reformatter. Others were involved in the later stages of the
group.

The Lockheed decompiler was used in several demonstrations that included
Phillips Petroleum, Ontario Hydro and the US Air Force. \"One of the
more humorous decompilations I ever did was the decompilation of a Monte
Carlo application that included a random number generator. The converted
random number generator was required to produce the same sequence of
random numbers, and the Monte Carlo application was required to generate
exactly the same results on the same inputs.\"

The Lockheed decompiler was used on a sizable project with Lockheed as
the subcontractor to Univac. This contract was won after Bill put on a
demonstration to the Air Force in Washington DC. Lambert Lui supported
Bill in this effort, and Maury attended the actual demo (to assure our
success, ashtrays were placed in the computer room for the Air Force
Colonel. The team was warned not to ask the Colonel to extinguish his
cigar.) The other vendors in the competition were IBM (using strictly
conversion) and CDC (using code simulation).

Starting in the fall of 1967 and completed in about May 1968, the US Air
Force Global Weather Center\'s weather forecasting programs (125
programs written in assembler and FORTRAN) were converted to run on the
Univac 1108 at the Offutt AFB in Omaha. Bill recalls having encountered
a bug in one of the decompiled programs \-- the largest assembler
program in the set. This program was 24K lines of code and 6K lines of
data (corresponding approximately to a 180K byte program). Using a set
of input data picked by the Air Force as part of an acceptance test, the
program generated by the decompiler would crash. After exhaustive manual
checking of the decompiled code, a parallel run of the original program
on the IBM 7094 was requested. The result? The parallel run showed that
the original program running against the same test data would crash too
\-- the bug was in the original program, and was faithfully reproduced
in the decompiled program.

\"We were very successful in decompiling programs that had resulted from
FORTRAN programs. These would run with little manual change. The IBM
7094 to Neliac Decompiler recognized FORTRAN calling sequences and
replaced them with a more compact version. For pure assembler programs,
the decompiler was estimated to remove 80-90% of the effort over manual
conversion. At that time, we estimated the cost of conversion to be less
than U\$1.00/instruction decompiled. This was substantially less than
the estimate at that time for manual conversion of assembler programs.\"

### []{#Attempts_at_Marketing_Decompilat} Attempts at Marketing Decompilation Services (1969-72)

Bill and Maury were part of a company in Lafayette, IN, formed in
1968-69 called Teknatronic Applications, Inc. (TAI). Company members
included three full-time staff. A group of professors (Maury Halstead,
Jay Nunamaker, Samuel Conte and Andrew Winston all of Purdue University,
Daniel Teichroew at University of Michigan and Glenn Graves of UCLA)
were board members and acted as TAI consultants. As one of the business
ventures at TAI, Maury had purchased a license from Lockheed to market
the IBM 7094 to Neliac decompiler as a conversion service. Marketing was
attempted through the Univac Information Systems Division (ISD) in
Chicago. A demo at the Chicago ISD was made. (As an amusing aside,
someone came in with a photocopy of 4 cards of binary code and asked
Bill to decompile this code. The decompiled Neliac code showed that the
cards were those of a simple numeric routine, whereas they had been
thought to be a complicated system interface.) This brief attempt to
market the decompilation service was a failure in that it produced no
business for TAI.

When the primary investors in TAI failed to produce sustaining capital
for the TAI, it was abandoned. In 1970, the company staff and university
associates established another company called Combinatorics (Also in
Lafayette, IN). In 1973, Combinatorics was bought by Mathematica, Inc.,
of Princeton, NJ.

Throughout this period, Maury supervised a PhD thesis on decompilation
at Purdue University, that of Barry Housel (awarded 1973). At the same
time, this was the period in which Maury began his formal investigation
of the complexity of programs, resulting in what are now known as the
\"Halstead Metrics\".

### []{#The_Sperry_Univac_494_to_1100_In} The Sperry\*Univac 494 to 1100 Inverse Compiler (1972-6)

The success of the Global Weather project with Univac in 1968 resulted
in a contract in 1972 between Combinatorics and Univac. Maury and Bill
were contracted to lead the effort for the Univac 494 to Series 1100
decompiler, which Univac preferred to call \"Inverse Compiler\". Maury
was a consultant to Bill on a one day/month basis. Bill was the
technical leader of the project for the two years of the contract with
Univac. During this contract, a feasibility study, functional
specification, design and initial implementation of the decompiler were
performed.

The Sperry\*Univac Inverse Compiler was made up of the following
modules: input processing, basic block generation, local data usage
analysis, control and data flow analysis, data mapping, reporting,
intermediate form preparation, level transformations, and target
language production. The model for decompilation is distinguished from
prior models by the extensive use of analysis techniques in an attempt
to derive data structures. The latter was in recognition of the fact
that data conversion is of primary importance. Additional details on the
analysis techniques are given in the previously unpublished paper [On
the Inverse of Compiling](OnInverseOfCompiling){.twikiLink} by Bill
Caudle, 1980.

The minimum input to the inverse compiler was the binary code in the
absolute or relocatable load modules. Additional input in the form of
the associated assembly and map listings for the program (produced by
the ASM or SPURT assemblers) were optional; these listings assisted in
the conversion process. The reporting module flagged missing libraries
and parts of the program that would be hard to decompile. Using the
input processor, the user could provide additional information to
completely define the instruction blocks, data blocks, and subroutine
definitions. Any information that the decompiler obtained by analysis
could be modified or enhanced by the conversion specialist. However, no
changes were allowed to be made to the binary programs, which remained
unmodified. The enhanced input files were then input to the decompiler
which produced [COBOL](COBOL){.twikiLink} code. The optimizer was
optionally used to improve the readability of the generated
[COBOL](COBOL){.twikiLink} code. The 1100 series sales memo from 1976
announces the 494 to 1100 inverse compiler.

The following figures were reported in internal documents:

-   Figure of merit: 67 to 87%. The figure of merit is the removed cost
    of resources required to successfully convert a program with the
    decompiler in ratio with the cost to convert the program manually.
-   Code expansion: 1.79 (inhouse evaluation: 1.6).
-   Translation cost: \$0.94 per line of assembler.
-   Decompiler cost: the cost of a decompiler with a high figure of
    merit was similar to the cost of a modern high-level language
    compiler.
-   Computer cost: the above per line costs included computer cost at
    approximately U\$160/hour.

Subsequent to the 2 year contract, Bill went to work with Sperry\*Univac
in Roseville, MN, and continued on the decompilation project for another
2 years. About 10 people worked on the decompilation project in
Roseville, with as many at times in Salt Lake City, UT. Work on
decompilation in Roseville was in the area of loop analysis, interval
analysis, global data analysis, and dictionary techniques. The Salt Lake
City group provided input processing, conversion to internal forms,
level transformations, and conversion to target language. Effectively,
this separated the project into that related to decompiler techniques
and that more directly related to compiler techniques.

In 1975, there was a version of the decompiler that generated PLUS (a
PL/1-like language for systems programming) code. Univac did a benchmark
test on decompilation in Zurich using the PLUS version. This was the
first conversion done outside their own environment. Bill led the team
in Zurich that translated 8 programs of 5600 lines of assembly code.
These programs were picked from the most difficult type of programs to
be converted and resulted in many improvements in the process. Part of
the results of this field test were the recommendation to use
[COBOL](COBOL){.twikiLink} as the target language.

As a result of this field effort, in late 1975/76 a version of the
inverse compiler was developed that generated [COBOL](COBOL){.twikiLink}
code. Both PLUS and [COBOL](COBOL){.twikiLink} target languages were
generated from the same internal representation used in the decompiler.
