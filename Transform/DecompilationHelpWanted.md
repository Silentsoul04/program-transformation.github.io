Could you please help me with a problem of Fortran decompilation? I\'m
in a huge trouble with an executable working in Win32 PC consolle mode
that is not working on all machines. I would like to find a tool or a
way to decompile it and recompile on these machines with Visual Fortran.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Do you know some place where I can find decompiling tools for Fortran
for PC compiled with Visual Fortran?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi - anyone know of any good Sparc decompilers?

I tried rec, but could not get it to work, rec is at:

<http://www.backerstreet.com/rec/rec.htm>

I also used yoe SPARC Disassembler, but it was not quite up to par -
lots of load and stores that were not displayed all the way. Plus, I had
to modify it not to go out of range when calculating label indexes.

I\'m trying to figure out the extended protocol for the sierra digital
cameras, this is **not** the same protocol as:

<http://photopc.sourceforge.net/protocol.html>

The raw sparc firmware of interest can be found using this search:

<http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22Nikon+Firmware+Update+for+Coolpix+E880%22&btnG=Google+Search>

Thanks for any pointers or help. Please post your response here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How about IDA Pro Advanced? Yes, it\'s commercial, but worth it if you
do a lot of disassembling.

Or \"objdump -d\" on a sparc machine? (Or use a cross dressing tool on
any other machine). I think you can tell it to use binary mode.

What format is the binary file in? I can\'t immediately see how to
download the appropriate files, and it doesn\'t say how big the whole
thing is.

So presumably these cameras have a SPARC processor in them\... pretty
amazing.

If you can post some quick pointers on how to get this file, I\'d be
happy to have a quick go at trying to find a sparc disassembler that
works for it.

PS what exactly was the disassembler that was not up to par?

**WHY JAVA DECOMPILERS ARE STALLING ?**

Java 5 is out for one year and THERE IS STILL NO DECOMPILER AWARE OF
JAVA 5. I recently submitted to JAD author, Mr. Kouznetsov, a couple of
bugs and asked his intentions about Java 5 support. He just answered
that he had no plan to enhance JAD anymore, even if, as I told him, he
has still no serious competitor in the field. Unfortunately, nor is he
willing to release the source code of JAD (developed in C++). It is
surprising that NOBODY is catching up for 3 YEARS. The only still
evolving programs are just wrappers around JAD like DeCafe Pro. One
could have a paranoid explanation and suspect the interference of
powerful lobbies here. Were the best decompilers authors \"persuaded\"
not to pursue their work further ;-) ?

I have not the time nor the knowledge to do it all by myself, but I have
a couple of ideas about the subject of Java decompilation and I\'m
willing to contribute to test, adapt and possibly enhance a Java 5
decompiler.

A good starting point could be to make a fair assessment of the
available open source projects like Jode or
[JReversePro](JReversePro){.twikiLink} and see if one is good enough to
serve as a code basis for further extension to make it at least as
powerful as JAD and Java 5 aware.

Comments, ideas, suggestions welcome

Mel (<melajara@yahoo.com>)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

An interesing point. I\'m peripherally interested in Java decompilers,
mainly because they are so good compared to machine code decompilers. I
think that the \"excitement\" phase has passed for Java decompilers, so
there is much less interest in it.

I would suggest starting with Jode rather than
[JReversePro](JReversePro){.twikiLink}; when I did test the Java
decompilers a few years ago, Jode was the pick of the bunch. That is,
unless you count Dava; it is the only one to claim to recover the types
for local variables correctly. Unfortunately, the author never got
around to merging his code with the latest Soot framework (Dava requires
Soot), and so it would appear that this code is lost to the general
public. Perhaps it might be possible to use the author\'s (Jerome
Miecznikowski\'s) papers on his work to implement the ideas in a more
accessable product like Jode. \--
