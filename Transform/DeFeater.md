[]{#Visual_Basic_Discompiler_Decompi} Visual Basic Discompiler (Decompiler) Defeater
====================================================================================

*This page only exists in archive.org for December 1996, which may be
the boundary of the archive. In case it disappears, therefore, I\'m
reproducing it here as a Wiki page; Visual Basic decompilers do seem to
be popular. The original page was
<http://www.shadow.net/~npi/dcompile.htm>. I have no idea how current
this is.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The discompiler (from DoDi in Germany) and allied tools really work. You
may think that the information is worthless because the names are not
too meaningful to you. However, get some experience reading someone
else\'s code and tracing how it works. The compiler creates good code,
at least typically good enough to make anybody nervous and interested in
defeating the decompilation process (you may want to review some of the
current and possible new legal issues on trade secrets, decompilation,
and methods to defeat encryption). The object names generated by the
discompiler actually make a lot of sense. When objects can be extracted
from the forms, the decompiler will show the original name. When objects
have been tokenized so that the name is not recoverable, the decompiler
will assign initials for objects and for uniqueness assign the memory
offset in the program. Realize that you can load the sources into the VB
development environment and globally change these variable names. For
example, a variable name called \"I0028\" is long integer that should
contain system information and the variable \"I002A\" is a message
string generated by the values from that information which you can
rename to \"mLoopCounter\" and \"sStatusString.\"

Furthermore, those demos and shareware sitting on BBS around the world
with their high bits slowly decaying to \"0\" are prime dumpsters for
source code. It is like picking through the printouts in the trash for
trade secrets. A couple bits here or there, a command triggered by a
.INI or the Windows registration file, and the demo is a real
application. That executable can be decompiled, studied for about an
hour or two, tweaked here and there, and then recompiled into a new
fully-functional application. What is copyright protection and trade
secret enforcement when the key to VB source is broken?

There are proactive solutions available. First, you can alter the source
code so that it is not so easily understood. That is a stupid approach
at face value because you cannot read it either and make much sense of
the code. This defeats the purpose of reusable code, code libraries,
team development, and Attila. However, this does not mean you can\'t
precompile your code and convert it into nonsense before the VB
compilation. This works, but you still get serialized variable names out
of the discompiler.

Second, you can alter the exectuable so that it is not as easily
decompiled. This means overwriting some of the names, addresses, and
objects so that the P-code will still run while the compiler will choke.
Obviously every change made forces the designers of decompilers to build
newer and better tools to retrieve the source code in spite of these
modications. It is a never-ending game. There have been decompilers and
disassemblers on PCs since CP/M. However, VB\'s P-code rather than true
compilation means that it is easier to get source that is in a higher
level form. My solution is the Decompiler Defeater, OVERRIDE.ZIP. I read
a few VB applications in hex code and deciphered where the objects and
text-based references were stored and overwrote them. That stopped the
decompiler (discompiler) for now. You can register the tool through
CompuServe SWREG 8135. The demo runs against all VB executable programs
(compiled runtime files). Some quirks do show up depending upon the
resources referenced in the VB runtime, but generally the full version
is innocuous and effective with current decompilers.

Another technique is to upgrade to VB 4.0. This does not defeat the
discompiler, but VB 4.0 provides conditional compilation so that demos,
shareware, and full versions are actually different executable files.
This minimizes your source code exposure\... somewhat. However, if you
combine all these techniques, you probably can make the application so
hard to crack that competitors will not try and you will keep out
unmotivated prying eyes. Hardware locks, specialized output devices, and
dongles can add to the decompiler\'s difficulty. However, you may also
create a puzzle, which by its very difficulty may attract hackers who
merely want to break it. Since hackers can disassemble Windows itself
(and there are workalike Win [API](API){.twikiLink} toolkits and Windows
emulations for other platforms), you might just think about updating
your applications often enough and with enough new enhancements each
time to stay ahead of the power curve.
