Advice on Writing a PEPM Research Paper {#advice-on-writing-a-pepm-research-paper .twikiTopicTitle}
=======================================

::: {.twikiWebTitle}
ACM SIGPLAN 2008 Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation
:::

The PEPM Symposium/Workshop series aims to bring together researchers
and practitioners working in the areas of program transformation and
generation. For PEPM 2006, the program chairs have written up advice for
authors of PEPM research paper submissions and tool demonstration paper
submissions. Advice for research papers is contained in this document;
advice for tool demo papers can be found at this link.

The scope of topics to be covered by PEPM is already discussed in the
Call For Papers and will not be addressed further in this document.
Please contact the program chairs if you have remaining questions about
the scope of PEPM.

### []{#Program_Goals} Program Goals

The primary goal of the PEPM Program Committee will be to assemble a
program that presents well-grounded and relevant contributions and that
generate forward-looking discussions that serve to create and drive a
dynamic research agenda that can significantly impact software
engineering practice. The Committee will aim to arrive at papers, tool
presentations, and discussions that collectively address the following
questions:

-   What is currently hindering programming transformation techniques
    and tools previously reported on at PEPM from being applied to solve
    real-world problems?
-   What are the challenging open technical, engineering, integration,
    and methodological problems in the area?
-   What new techniques are being developed that have the potential to
    address these problems?
-   What are the existing and emerging applications areas that can
    benefit from program transformation technology?
-   How can program transformation tools be integrated in the context of
    other software engineering tools and development environments and
    broader software engineering methodologies?

[]{#Program_Committee_Expectations} Program Committee Expectations
------------------------------------------------------------------

Below we provide guidelines and suggestions that PEPM authors should
take into account when preparing submissions. Although there\'s a fair
amount of material below, we want to emphasize that we are mindful of
the fact that PEPM is a workshop this year and we don\'t expect perfect
papers!! \-- even though we hope each author will do their best to put
together a solid submission. In other words, the advice below is meant
to inspire you and give you ideas for improving your submission \--
it\'s not meant to scare you.

### []{#Original_Work} Original Work

All papers should be original work, and not have been previously
published nor have been submitted to, or be in consideration for, any
journal, book, conference, or workshop. Note that PEPM Tool
Demonstration Papers have less restrictive conditions on novelty.

### []{#Commendable_Qualities} Commendable Qualities

-   **Clear contributions:** The contributions of the paper should be
    stated clearly/explicitly in the introduction of the paper and
    elaborated on in the rest of the paper body. Moreover, limitations
    should be acknowledged and, if possible, future work that could
    overcome those limitations should be mentioned.
-   **Well-written:** The presentation in the paper should proceed in a
    coherent fashion that is relatively free from spelling and
    grammatical mistakes (use a spell-checker and even a grammar checker
    if possible!). Concepts should be illustrated with meaningful
    examples.
-   **Relevant to real-world problems/contexts:** Authors should clearly
    indicate actual real-world contexts and applications in which they
    envision their work (when fully mature) being applied. Issues such
    as scalability, analysis precision, degree of automation, learning
    curve, etc. that might hinder the use of the technique in practice
    should be acknowledged and assessed.
-   **Well-supported claims:** When appropriate (e.g., when proposing a
    new analysis/transformation technique designed to improve
    performance, reduce foot print, etc.), submissions should support
    claims by reporting on the results of case studies. This would
    typically involve reporting on computational costs of analyses and
    transformations, using multiple examples to illustrate the
    scalability of the approach, reporting numbers for speed-up factors
    and other positive benefits that result from the approach.
-   **Properly positioned to related work:** Submissions should include
    a related work section that summarizes and contrasts closely related
    work. Related work should not simply list previous papers with a
    brief summary of their contents, nor should it state only the
    strengths of the submission and the weakness of previous work. A
    proper related work section should state both the
    strengths/weaknesses of the submission and previous and indicate
    situations in which one method might be preferred over another.
-   **Clear methodology and integration into larger development
    context:** Authors should clearly indicate the steps that users
    should go through to apply a technique including any manual
    preprocessing, tool configuration, assessment of output, etc.
    Moreover, an assessment of how the technique fits into the context
    of other development tools such as debuggers, testing, integrated
    development environments, etc. Here are some examples. If the
    proposed technique is a generative programming technique in which
    users are not expected to read generated code, what mechanisms might
    be provided to to aid debugging of generated code. How does the
    transformation interact with the use of library code? Is there any
    impact on how the system is tested?
-   **Supporting material:** The community benefits significantly when
    tools, examples, data, and other artifacts presented in papers are
    made available on web-sites. While publicly available
    tools/artifacts are not required, shared tools and examples are
    extremely useful for comparing techniques, forging collaborative
    relationships, generating further research, and forming accurate
    assessments of the capabilities of a technique.

You might also find this advice on how to structure a research paper
helpful. It is also a good idea to have your paper reviewed by
colleagues before submitting.

### []{#Common_Flaws} Common Flaws

When considering how to write a contribution that helps us meet the
goals above, it is worthwhile to consider common flaws in unsuccessful
submissions or papers that failed to have an impact on advancing the
agenda of the community.

-   **Language contexts of limited relevance:** Early work in partial
    evaluation (PE) was often carried out in the context of the
    lambda-calculus because it served as a clean core language in which
    basic techniques could be formalized and reasoned about in a
    rigorous way. However, now that basic partial evaluation techniques
    are well-understood, PEPM submissions should aim to present
    techniques in the context of commonly-used programming languages.
    While papers may present or formalize a technique in terms of a
    \"clean core language\", submissions that attempt to handle
    realistic language features or convincingly argue that the proposed
    techniques can be applied to more challenging language featuers, may
    be more highly valued since they provide a more effective foundation
    for transitioning techniques into actual software development
    practice. Exceptions to this general rule might occur if a
    submission is attempting to show, e.g., the benefits of
    transformation/optimization on representations used in
    theorem-proving tools that use extensions of the lambda-calculus as
    an underlying representation.
-   **Failure to provide examples/applications that speak to a broader
    community:** Early work in partial evaluation often used the \"power
    function\", \"dot product\" or similar examples to illustrate a
    technique. Since PE concepts are now fairly well-understood in the
    PEPM community, such examples should be avoided in PEPM submissions
    and replaced with examples that could convey the utility of PE and
    other program transformation techniques to a larger audience. Our
    aim is to grow the number of people from other areas that look to
    PEPM for solutions relevant to their problems. People from other
    applications domains will likely find examples such as those listed
    above irrelevant and unconvincing. It\'s time for PE to move beyond
    the power function.
-   **Limited or unclear scalability:** Unsuccessful papers have
    presented techniques without providing (a) some form of experimental
    studies containing time/memory costs that indicate the scalability
    of the approach or (b) assessment of forms of human intervention
    that would be necessary to make the technique work in practice. A
    common example of the later flaw is the failure of many papers on
    partial evaluation to address the need/costs of \"binding-time
    improvements\" needed to make partial evaluation effective. There
    has long been the need for work that provides semi-automation of
    binding-time improvements or that provides program development or
    refactoring environments that would aid in binding-time
    improvements. It is important to note that the program committee
    doesn\'t expect every paper to describe a completely automated
    technique that is easy to use, provides huge speed-ups, and scales
    to systems of 100K lines of code. However, the submission should
    acknowledge limitations, whenever possible give results of
    experiments that show computational costs on **multiple**
    non-trivial examples, and explain why/how the computational/human
    overhead may be overcome in the context of a realistic development
    environment.
-   **Lack of clear correctness notions:** Some papers prove
    unsatisfactory because they do not clearly state what properties a
    transformation aims to preserve. In general, a paper need not
    include detailed correctness proofs or theorems (though these are
    certainly welcome, they might be published in a separate tech report
    that is available at the time of review), but authors should clearly
    state the properties that they aim to preserve and any forms of
    unsoundness associated with the technique.
-   **Lack of clear methodology:** Many papers present techniques
    without a description of a step-by-step process that they expect
    users will need to go through to apply the technique. Issues such as
    initial binding-time improvement or refactoring of source code,
    stubbing out or annotating library methods, assessing code for
    potential benefit for applying transformation techniques, etc. are
    often ignored. As a classic example, the fact that the need for
    manual binding-time improvements/annotations has been \"swept under
    the rug\" in many PEPM papers has significantly hindered non-experts
    in applying PE techniques.
-   **Interaction with larger development context:** Many papers present
    techniques without taking care to explain how their technique fits
    into a larger software development process (how are other
    specification, testing, and debugging tools impacted, what type of
    experience/training is will be needed to apply a technique).
-   **Poor related work comparisons:** Papers often suffer from poor
    related work comparisons in which authors follow a pattern \"our
    tool is better at TASK-X than tool T1 because \..., our tool is
    better at TASK-Y than tool T2 because \...\" (all the while ignoring
    the fact that tool T1 has a much broader scope than the authors\'
    tool or that it is in fact better than the authors\' tool for many
    aspects not mentioned in the paper). Authors should strive to give a
    balanced and fair assessment listing both strengths and weakness of
    all work considered.

### []{#Example_Paper_Types} Example Paper Types

-   **New transformation technique:** The most common type of PEPM paper
    will report on a new analysis/transformation technique. Such papers
    should include a detailed description of the technique, some sort of
    formal or informal argument about why the technique is correct,
    illustrate the technique on interesting examples, and evaluate the
    effectiveness of the technique.
-   **Case studies:** This type of paper might report on the use of an
    existing technique to a large example(s). Such papers should take
    care to indicate what new and significant insights were gained in
    the case study (what the technique effective, was it easy to apply,
    could it be applied by the \"average software engineer\", does it
    have particular flaws that need to be remedied, how does it fit
    within a larger development context). In the technique is a
    performance enhancing technique, significant attention should be
    paid to experimental studies.
-   **Description of new/interesting domain and potential for effective
    use of PEPM techniques:** This type of paper might describe a
    particular application domain (e.g., middleware, avionics systems,
    active networks) or a particular development paradigm (e.g.,
    model-driven development, ) and describe how techniques within the
    scope of PEPM might be applied effectively in that domain. Special
    attention should be given to enumerating the problems/challenges of
    the domain, characteristics that suggest that it might benefit from
    PEPM techniques, initial attempts at applying those techniques, and
    questions/challenges to be addressed by future work. Such papers
    should aim to educate the PEPM community about
    interesting/fundamental issues of the domain, and give pointers to
    where they may learn more about the issues.

### []{#What_About_Work_In_Progress}[]{#What_About_Work_In_Progress_} What About Work In Progress?

Due to the workshop format adopted for PEPM this year, we do encourage
submissions of \"work in progress\" in cases where the submission raises
issues that will generate interesting discussions at the meeting, brings
new knowledge of a particular application domain or technique to the
community, or lays out challenging open problems of high relevance to
software engineering practice. Depending on the quality and number of
such submissions, we may collect work-in-progress papers into a single
session with slightly shorter time slots for each presentation and a
longer discussion time at the end of the session.
